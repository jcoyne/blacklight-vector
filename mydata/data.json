{"title":"Pushing transport layer latency down towards its physical limits in data centers with programmable architectures and algorithms","abstract":"Data center applications keep scaling horizontally across many machines to accommodate more users and data. This makes the communication performance requirements even more stringent, i.e., higher bandwidth and lower latency. The increasing link capacities address the bandwidth demands, but the latency requirements necessitate more sophisticated solutions. In this thesis, I observe that the transport layer is the only layer in the networking stack to impact latency both at the end-hosts and the network. The way it handles packets sets the end-hosts processing delay. And its congestion control determines the queuing delay in the network. Hence, I study transport layer designs to push both latencies down to their physical limits. First, I argue that end-host latency can be minimized by offloading the transport layer to NIC hardware, but fixed-function chips prohibit custom solutions for diversified environments. As a solution, I introduce nanoTransport, a programmable NIC architecture for message-based Remote Procedure Calls. It is programmed using the P4 language, making it easy to modify (or create) transport protocols while the packets are processed orders of magnitude faster than traditional software stacks. It identifies common events and primitive operations for a streamlined, modular, and programmable pipeline; including packetization, reassembly, timeouts, and packet generation, all expressed by the programmer. Next, I argue that network latency can only be minimized with quick and accurate congestion control decisions, which require precise congestion signals and the shortest control loop delay. I present Bolt to address these requirements and push congestion control to its theoretical limits. Bolt is based on three core ideas, (I) Sub-RTT Control (SRC) reacts to congestion faster than one RTT, (II) Proactive Ramp-up (PRU) foresees flow completions to promptly occupy released bandwidth, and (III) Supply matching (SM) matches bandwidth demand with supply to maximize utilization.

{"title":"Inferring RNA structure and stability via high-throughput experiment","abstract":"The computer-aided study and design of RNA molecules is increasingly prevalent across a range of disciplines, yet advancing RNA design will require quantitative improvements in predicting RNA structure. The first part of this dissertation describes contributions to advancing RNA thermodynamics predictions, a highlight of which is the development of a novel multitask-learning-based model that links the training of an RNA thermodynamic model to the statistical mechanics of several prediction tasks. We trained this framework using large datasets of diverse synthetic constructs obtained from the crowdsourced RNA design project, Eterna. The resulting algorithm, EternaFold, demonstrated improved performance on diverse independent datasets, including complete viral genomes probed in virion, human mRNAs probed in vivo, and synthetic designs modeling mRNA vaccines. This work establishes an extensive benchmark for evaluating RNA secondary structure ensembles through several types of experiment, and a general statistical mechanical framework for inferring energetic parameters from equilibrium experimental observables. The second part of this dissertation describes advances in a pressing application of RNA design: creating more thermostable RNA vaccines. Vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) emerged as forerunners in the current COVID-19 pandemic and show promise as a novel therapeutic platform, yet their inherent chemical instability sets a fundamental limit on the stability of mRNA vaccines. Predictions from our developed biophysical models indicated that the half-life of any mRNA could be immediately increased at least two-fold through sequence design, predictions validated in vitro and in vivo. We anticipate this work will guide future therapeutic and vaccine development in potency and stability.","vector":[-0.06625517457723618,-0.10466339439153671,-0.02521880529820919,0.02660318650305271,0.05193210020661354,0.02961636334657669,-0.0545261949300766,0.04773378744721413,-0.006318347528576851,0.0671120211482048,-0.10010518878698349,-0.07463572919368744,0.0087931789457798,0.030196547508239746,-0.05277293547987938,0.006625373847782612,-0.05534304678440094,0.011863297782838345,-0.019758781418204308,-0.06030430644750595,0.022165479138493538,0.07394882291555405,0.06284137070178986,-0.007856040261685848,0.02611047402024269,-0.007242110557854176,0.03161022067070007,0.06898017227649689,-0.07086119055747986,-0.01534777507185936,0.03654985874891281,-0.07972002774477005,0.027378583326935768,-0.024830767884850502,-0.04842153191566467,0.015780210494995117,-0.05475277453660965,-0.042041752487421036,-0.005671077873557806,0.05179818347096443,0.02896474115550518,0.03858489915728569,0.011726325377821922,0.03228933364152908,0.08477819710969925,0.0009540939936414361,-0.04421957582235336,-0.03423318639397621,0.03163184970617294,0.05875162035226822,-0.009098486043512821,-0.0575442761182785,-0.05374222248792648,0.03253314271569252,0.05282728374004364,0.06158291921019554,-0.03649527579545975,-0.05430504307150841,-0.05078066512942314,-0.09624597430229187,0.0008300343179143965,-0.09627377986907959,-0.05218737572431564,-0.027554137632250786,0.06039562076330185,-0.028226949274539948,0.0546637587249279,0.1126333624124527,-0.0072570196352899075,0.013745763339102268,-0.046423524618148804,0.13820143043994904,-0.0725618451833725,0.10059044510126114,0.05875460430979729,0.008941390551626682,0.05448072776198387,0.022460686042904854,0.06971535086631775,-0.09331896901130676,-0.028756218031048775,-0.019987482577562332,0.08777783811092377,0.027380594983696938,-0.0226492490619421,0.056515127420425415,0.034444790333509445,0.0888051986694336,0.054909419268369675,0.03138180077075958,-0.011234474368393421,0.01782042160630226,0.028828781098127365,0.00956685934215784,-0.015582234598696232,0.07358245551586151,0.06119632348418236,-0.016853144392371178,0.027491770684719086,-0.006578732281923294,-0.034337710589170456,0.03626161441206932,0.00885180477052927,-0.008889594115316868,0.0964149460196495,-0.03145211562514305,0.06806487590074539,-0.01927053928375244,0.04508035257458687,0.023203115910291672,0.048613015562295914,0.06548251211643219,-0.008059893734753132,-0.019773287698626518,0.06386508792638779,0.01143569964915514,-0.0650869682431221,0.006121529266238213,0.02837524749338627,0.07532066851854324,0.003274722956120968,-0.028136035427451134,-0.0005832669558003545,0.008804678916931152,-0.052547186613082886,-0.023556914180517197,-0.05890041962265968,1.005810363748648e-33,0.06139732152223587,-0.03250821307301521,0.0713610053062439,0.09855964034795761,0.07394496351480484,-0.05738810449838638,-0.016594210639595985,0.021325210109353065,-0.08561863005161285,-0.018768325448036194,-0.04429597035050392,-0.04903227090835571,-0.04087383672595024,0.09035217761993408,-0.016560427844524384,0.005672928877174854,-0.052031029015779495,0.023576846346259117,-0.0866449847817421,-0.002474154345691204,0.048492949455976486,0.015626654028892517,0.04671433940529823,-0.039415307343006134,0.004970998968929052,0.0019073671428486705,0.015604496002197266,0.028027521446347237,-0.04002634808421135,0.0006196094327606261,-0.08503451943397522,0.019552083685994148,-0.061488665640354156,0.08191459625959396,0.03342686593532562,-0.08999720960855484,-0.019894583150744438,-0.03122473880648613,0.08451489359140396,0.033731985837221146,0.08481896668672562,-0.004561680369079113,0.04750780016183853,-0.013394159264862537,-0.03962637484073639,-0.005833486095070839,-0.014554726891219616,-0.02282879129052162,-0.038918331265449524,-0.03587011247873306,0.08616156131029129,-0.027743708342313766,0.09414075314998627,-0.022080697119235992,-0.05544253811240196,0.018545866012573242,-0.05585692450404167,-0.017816955223679543,0.025388816371560097,0.01515146903693676,-0.09344513714313507,0.054803516715765,0.08128475397825241,0.04354986548423767,-0.03850478306412697,0.09072594344615936,-0.07456142455339432,-0.07896077632904053,0.02572808787226677,0.06527552753686905,0.031201744452118874,0.004995196126401424,-0.02486029639840126,-0.057435646653175354,-0.0026627248153090477,0.020396653562784195,0.06055401638150215,-0.01109373476356268,-0.046677179634571075,0.0813634917140007,-0.020595213398337364,0.03196579962968826,-0.020133810117840767,-0.031298719346523285,-0.08642339706420898,-0.11631626635789871,0.03742818906903267,-0.08056748658418655,-0.033596742898225784,0.030868932604789734,-0.07633174955844879,0.012000425718724728,-0.021979281678795815,-0.03357144817709923,-0.010278339497745037,-2.1903114808566304e-33,-0.022070778533816338,0.014575743116438389,-0.02072054333984852,0.03018997237086296,-0.054392747581005096,0.04135587811470032,-0.015179701149463654,-0.12850724160671234,0.005389299243688583,-0.026837226003408432,0.07422849535942078,-0.001113697187975049,0.03128793463110924,-0.0792183130979538,0.028

{"title":"Investigating the functional effects of enhanced glucose metabolism in T cells with chimeric antigen receptors","abstract":"The combination of intensive nutrient requirements needed to sustain T cell activation and proliferation, alongside competition for nutrients within the tumor microenvironment suggest that glucose availability could limit CAR T cell function. Here we sought to test the hypothesis that stable overexpression (OE) of the glucose transporter GLUT1 in primary human CAR-T cells would improve function and antitumor potency. We observed that GLUT1OE CAR T cells manifest increased glucose uptake at rest and following activation, and this is associated with increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, GLUT1OE also enhanced MTOR signaling and broadly modulated metabolic programming, with substantial increases in glutathione mediated resistance to reactive oxygen species, and enhanced urea cycle and arginine metabolism. We observed no evidence for increased T cell exhaustion with GLUT1OE, but rather observed increased TCF1+ and CD62L, consistent with stemness programming. GLUT1OE CAR T cells showed increased cytokine production in response to tumor challenge and manifested superior tumor control in vivo. Our collective findings support a model wherein glucose availability is rate limiting for optimal effector CAR-T cell function and demonstrate that enhancing glucose availability via GLUT1 OE provides a new approach to augment antitumor immune function.","vector":[-0.10511640459299088,0.01641405001282692,-0.010068790055811405,0.002543728332966566,0.03966629505157471,0.008325250819325447,0.0302183348685503,0.07906869053840637,0.06349215656518936,-0.0025258457753807306,-0.11532159149646759,0.043721310794353485,0.02328135259449482,-0.0009468038915656507,-0.0015958682633936405,-0.007110388483852148,0.05573582276701927,0.0200039055198431,-0.039923761039972305,-0.07251863181591034,0.0726376324892044,-0.018377255648374557,0.06865151971578598,0.010632393881678581,0.02105124294757843,-0.10393275320529938,-0.023042352870106697,-0.039188921451568604,-0.08279696106910706,0.03396645933389664,-0.06492084264755249,-0.05565264821052551,-0.06165387108922005,0.07742435485124588,-0.12065351754426956,0.032814886420965195,-0.04089149460196495,0.02042756974697113,-0.11248508840799332,-0.03321513906121254,0.006312981713563204,-0.06773076951503754,-0.03336801007390022,0.026008645072579384,0.03367137163877487,-0.09667763113975525,0.013175242580473423,-0.04394526034593582,-0.0344119668006897,0.030037229880690575,-0.012391339056193829,0.0671558529138565,-0.04422967880964279,0.022914553061127663,0.04478258639574051,0.05937821418046951,-0.022611936554312706,0.10346844792366028,-0.03255093842744827,-0.053770147264003754,-0.052214350551366806,-0.06954926997423172,0.06326576322317123,-0.004092219285666943,0.04507153481245041,-0.0733402669429779,-0.09646738320589066,0.01661786437034607,-0.14006341993808746,-0.007906103506684303,-0.0246777031570673,0.010266454890370369,-0.053004197776317596,-0.002901308238506317,-0.07614312320947647,0.04817420616745949,-0.0045087579637765884,0.06677587330341339,-0.007342788856476545,0.05612308531999588,0.0755734071135521,0.018505752086639404,0.11255162209272385,0.023149272426962852,-0.013057305477559566,-0.02538049779832363,0.012321298010647297,0.1198510155081749,0.03853475674986839,0.05405979976058006,0.004211456514894962,0.061395835131406784,0.014278317801654339,0.09871438145637512,0.016121404245495796,-0.02693874016404152,-0.02434377372264862,-0.10450811684131622,0.009303152561187744,-0.03818379342556,-0.047177258878946304,0.05021214857697487,0.11113806813955307,0.024765972048044205,-0.01998754031956196,0.005644029937684536,-0.00812100525945425,0.05116921290755272,0.03736725449562073,0.02011347934603691,0.09376433491706848,0.036814264953136444,0.034519586712121964,0.04117375612258911,-0.03482205048203468,0.07702869921922684,-0.040228866040706635,0.0012023627059534192,-0.00483753951266408,0.044617652893066406,-0.028051454573869705,-0.05096648260951042,0.025370081886649132,-0.06291937828063965,0.05915460363030434,0.08343847095966339,0.0322507843375206,5.393754359380128e-33,0.03862623870372772,-0.026729533448815346,0.03824302926659584,0.0657552108168602,0.04030541703104973,0.013641375117003918,-0.03284420073032379,0.044893067330121994,0.015990879386663437,-0.040134117007255554,-0.04875298961997032,-0.07622623443603516,-0.04496978595852852,7.31120235286653e-05,-0.09679337590932846,-0.01086450181901455,-0.057807520031929016,-0.04246901348233223,0.085184745490551,-0.09900709241628647,0.0078074331395328045,-0.046718619763851166,0.010662726126611233,-0.024757716804742813,-0.0056722164154052734,0.01837790571153164,-0.028091048821806908,0.05355670675635338,0.020400552079081535,0.011160198599100113,-0.11842044442892075,-0.03372299298644066,0.016013385728001595,-0.01752794161438942,-0.015112063847482204,-0.012862791307270527,-0.05152325704693794,-0.027245763689279556,0.060317713767290115,0.03129391372203827,0.034367721527814865,-0.03334229439496994,0.06649678945541382,-0.0990099236369133,0.0025035247672349215,-0.07599388808012009,0.03569425269961357,-0.017506463453173637,-0.07310891151428223,0.11448301374912262,-0.03507189825177193,-0.04813297837972641,0.014404209330677986,0.011394308879971504,-0.021893322467803955,0.022229764610528946,-0.07933524250984192,0.023088738322257996,-0.02847720868885517,0.03656776249408722,-0.023634277284145355,-0.013270881026983261,0.02652125433087349,0.026768825948238373,-0.015468360856175423,0.03069811314344406,-0.14363430440425873,-0.07279547303915024,-0.010194391012191772,0.10333804786205292,0.08718513697385788,-0.03401782736182213,0.08321255445480347,-0.013691730797290802,0.009805445559322834,0.02777034416794777,0.11595607548952103,0.04981604591012001,-0.0354139544069767,0.005810700356960297,-0.008814451284706593,-0.03964615613222122,-0.01870882883667946,0.01059778407216072,-0.07515735924243927,-0.04429957643151283,-0.060510240495204926,-0.061512771993875504,0.018416769802570343,-0.05515177175402641,-0.01945161260664463,0.017065105959773064,-0.03520112484693527,-0.01843319647014141,-0.035668473690748215,-5.8040654379804474e-33,0.08009311556816101,-0.053319502621889114,0.10049490630626678,-0.06884586066007614,0.07977716624736786,0.03829771280288696,-0.03167925402522087,-0.0979229286313057,0.03881553187966347,-0.018898099660873413,0.023100391030311584,0.08813689649105072,0.02332770824432373,-0.06607476621866226,-0.021476162

{"title":"Regulation of arabidopsis stomatal development and patterning by the AGCVIII kinase family","abstract":"With multicellularity has come additional capacity for cells to become functionally and structurally diverse; along with diversity comes a need for organization and patterning. The formation of distinct cell types is often linked to asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) in which a cell divides to create daughters that differ in size, composition, proximity to signaling sources, and ultimately fate. Cortical cell polarity is an important feature of ACDs. In animal cells, the PAR proteins play an important role in establishing cortical polarity driving ACDs and axis formation, but they are conspicuously absent from plant genomes. Interestingly, we see the conservation of mechanistic logic cells used to build polarity complexes. For example, AGC kinases enforce or reinforce cell polarity in plants, animals, and fungi. The stomatal lineage of Arabidopsis thaliana presents us with a unique opportunity to understand how cell polarity and orchestrated cell divisions contribute to a robust developmental plan. Core to this process are the cortically polarized scaffolding proteins BREAKING OF ASYMMETRY IN THE STOMATAL LINEAGE (BASL) and the BREVIS RADIX family (BRXf). These novel, plant-specific proteins are required to ensure proper asymmetric divisions in stomatal lineage cells. Loss of BASL results in more symmetric divisions and an over-proliferation of epidermal cells of mixed identity. To further elucidate BASL/BRXf's ability to confer ACD competency to stomatal lineage cells, we, in collaboration with proteomics specialist Geert De Jager (VIB Belgium), did a protein interaction screen that yielded several interaction partners for BRXL2. Among the candidates identified in the assay were members of the plant-specific PIN-FORMED (PINs) family and members of the AGCVIII kinase family.  In this thesis, I present genetic and cell biological data that support a novel role for the AGCVIII kinase D6PK in facilitating asymmetric cell division and asymmetric fate acquisition in the stomatal lineages through the BASL and BRXL2. D6PK is broadly expressed in the leaf and is present in stomatal lineage cells, mature pavement cells, and guard cells. Furthermore, D6PK is localized to the BASL/BRXf polarity complex in the stomatal lineage. Its polarization mirrors BASL and BRX proteins during asymmetric cell division in that the D6PK polar crescent is inherited by the larger daughter cell. Further, we show that D6PK is required for patterning stomata. Stomatal lineage cells in the d6pk012 triple mutant background divided excessively and occasionally acquired identical fates, resulting in paired guard cells. Known transcriptional regulators are also disrupted in d6pk012. Due to the nature of the phenotype, we speculated that D6PK might be a core member of the BASL/BRXf polarity complex or a regulator of polarity. D6PK and BASL polarity are mutually dependent, while D6PK maintained some ability to polarize in the brxq background.

{"title":"Essays in industrial organization","abstract":"This dissertation examines the welfare effects of policies in online advertising, the movie industry, and the pharmaceutical market. By combining empirical analysis with structural modeling, it evaluates how these policies affect consumers and firms, identifies market imperfections, and assesses the potential for regulatory intervention to enhance social welfare.    The first chapter investigates the welfare implications of sponsored product advertising on retail platforms like Amazon. The findings suggest that removing advertising could benefit consumers and sellers under a fixed commission rate by eliminating low-quality sponsored results and reducing prices, but would harm them if Amazon optimally adjusts the commission rate. The study recommends limiting sponsored positions rather than banning advertising altogether.   The second chapter, co-authored with Luming Chen and Xuejie Yi, studies vertical integration in China's movie industry. The results indicate that vertical integration helps mitigate distortions from revenue-sharing contracts, but steers demand toward integrated movies. Overall, vertical integration increases consumer surplus with considerable heterogeneity across markets.   The final chapter, co-authored with Shengmao Cao and Xuejie Yi, analyzes a competitive bidding program in China's pharmaceutical market. While the program successfully reduces prices, it raises concerns about distortions in drug choices. The study suggests that competitive bidding can enhance consumer welfare if the brand premium is deemed irrelevant to welfare considerations.","vector":[-0.05917815491557121,-0.014361731708049774,0.0015744705451652408,-0.07896599173545837,0.04441549628973007,0.08686746656894684,0.024234307929873466,0.0763336792588234,0.03436187654733658,-0.07764603197574615,-0.007046459708362818,0.10087478905916214,0.0593990758061409,-0.029956385493278503,0.10939611494541168,-0.06275935471057892,0.12225420773029327,0.03216168284416199,-0.08093919605016708,-0.02594749815762043,0.004900479689240456,-0.08174078911542892,0.037778615951538086,0.07533790916204453,-0.076589435338974,-0.12862876057624817,-0.05444960668683052,0.015056423842906952,-0.030581092461943626,-0.06392710655927658,0.0016055627493187785,0.021018508821725845,0.061691444367170334,0.02844773232936859,0.05980462208390236,-0.043470315635204315,-0.10611511766910553,-0.10840088129043579,-0.06271830946207047,0.02611166052520275,0.04780709370970726,-0.052314069122076035,-0.09673572331666946,-0.024435706436634064,0.10337561368942261,-0.0780087262392044,0.08515018224716187,0.08868050575256348,0.01433598157018423,0.05939289182424545,-0.028989829123020172,0.04252878203988075,0.011272049508988857,-0.0017008434515446424,0.010066982358694077,-0.032331690192222595,0.005697243381291628,-0.009339836426079273,0.016964811831712723,0.04749257117509842,0.006318194791674614,-0.012478797696530819,-0.0370955765247345,0.07221554964780807,0.04524495080113411,-0.029165200889110565,-0.0725058764219284,0.07102006673812866,-0.08977523446083069,0.04225636646151543,-0.03912878409028053,-0.06049969047307968,-0.011316693387925625,-0.019358165562152863,0.010144432075321674,-0.08851908892393112,0.018511243164539337,0.010409894399344921,0.04545487090945244,-0.04992571100592613,0.010650183074176311,-0.14493092894554138,-0.10961738228797913,0.03704676777124405,-0.044237684458494186,-0.07969148457050323,0.03689349442720413,-0.057291414588689804,0.04227446764707565,0.01309216022491455,0.010529293678700924,0.04474617540836334,-0.018379034474492073,0.05027978494763374,-0.0070620509795844555,-0.015522719360888004,-0.01980486325919628,0.02304982580244541,0.014041716232895851,0.07316074520349503,0.012102393433451653,-0.04821068048477173,0.03196902200579643,-0.03542026877403259,-0.03536312282085419,-0.09874722361564636,-0.043970782309770584,0.11744885891675949,0.03933929651975632,0.1210082620382309,-0.06880509108304977,0.02062198333442211,0.024144645780324936,0.0009820638224482536,0.013783575966954231,-0.014606146141886711,0.001432736637070775,0.03641410917043686,0.03799663484096527,-0.014484858140349388,0.0031537555623799562,-0.00044363498454913497,0.06443938612937927,-0.04013663902878761,0.030451735481619835,0.012664571404457092,-0.05016452446579933,1.0473981600192904e-33,-0.027945518493652344,0.020682869479060173,0.009847203269600868,-0.07324682176113129,-0.016572874039411545,0.0720212459564209,-0.006521150935441256,0.054239869117736816,-0.08490811288356781,0.09640664607286453,-0.06396903842687607,0.0165567509829998,-0.04156880080699921,0.12733371555805206,0.0689493790268898,0.026316320523619652,-0.0130287054926157,-0.028789350762963295,0.022522583603858948,0.018615886569023132,-0.025566209107637405,0.03878695145249367,-0.0831850990653038,0.041332803666591644,-0.0879502147436142,-0.07075682282447815,-0.06961121410131454,-0.04124351218342781,0.01285350788384676,0.03878510370850563,-0.03796330839395523,0.02183012291789055,0.10389019548892975,-0.04655257239937782,-0.01860717684030533,-0.04807678610086441,-0.06322535127401352,-0.048944927752017975,-0.0007025692029856145,0.0067288074642419815,-0.08743272721767426,0.013200927525758743,-0.023851439356803894,0.014405446127057076,-0.028676539659500122,0.06643883883953094,0.01606215350329876,-0.011257472448050976,-0.017423134297132492,0.03856522589921951,0.0013258598046377301,0.05854586139321327,0.0683370977640152,-0.03465789183974266,-0.022199364379048347,-0.015584700740873814,-0.1225203350186348,-0.08899138122797012,-0.06233874335885048,-0.07826501131057739,0.0009971437975764275,-0.012930158525705338,0.04256183281540871,0.054217033088207245,-0.06889756768941879,0.050233349204063416,0.041494522243738174,-0.013999301940202713,-0.009268855676054955,-0.009211164899170399,-0.029404018074274063,0.024646781384944916,-0.034630510956048965,-0.053902413696050644,-0.052256543189287186,-0.019811732694506645,-0.04785875976085663,0.0316513255238533,0.07986895740032196,0.024601010605692863,0.0034503245260566473,-0.051488641649484634,0.07657730579376221,-0.00878249853849411,-0.037758566439151764,-0.005874413065612316,0.028203554451465607,-0.01115691103041172,0.0764007419347763,-0.01471752766519785,-0.018418708816170692,0.02259288728237152,-0.09325176477432251,0.050472572445869446,0.0715942308306694,-3.671597462733889e-33,-0.022774361073970795,0.013389745727181435,0.020498812198638916,-0.05049790441989899,-0.06762591004371643,-0.009104988537728786,-0.049348726868629456,-0.05009111389517784,0.017633037641644478,-0.009778174571692944,-0.09101419895887375,-0.013083810918033123,-0.005972846411168575,0.0041

{"title":"How the brain resolves conflicts between needs across time","abstract":"Animals survive in the world by maintaining the integrity of their bodies. This process, called homeostasis, involves the careful balance of physiological needs. To promote behavior supporting this balance, the brain integrates information about physiological deficits and produces internal states known as drives. These survival drives are powerful sculptors of behavior: a hungry animal will eat; a thirsty animal will drink. What happens when both needs occur, and in similar amounts? In my PhD, I was inspired by an old philosophical quandary of conflicting needs, first stated by Aristotle and later reframed by Spinoza as \"Buridan's ass\": an equally hungry and thirsty donkey stuck between equidistant food and water. I reasoned that this thought experiment highlights an incomplete behavioral, neural, and conceptual framework relating basic needs to behavior. Is there a singular moment of decision between multiple needs? Where in the brain are such conflicting needs resolved, and how does their resolution relate to the activity of individual neurons?   In this dissertation, I will discuss new experimental observations and a computational and conceptual framework for how the brain organizes behavior under multiple concurrent needs. I will first discuss a novel experimental paradigm called Buridan's assay. In it, a hungry, thirsty mouse makes repeated choices between equidistant food and water until it is satiated for both. Using behavioral analysis and optogenetic experiments, I found that choices between conflicting needs are fundamentally stochastic and exhibit periods of persistent behavioral states punctuated by spontaneous switches. To reveal the neural underpinning of this phenomenon, I used high density extracellular electrophysiological recordings to monitor simultaneous activity of many hundreds of neurons across the brain. I found that a substantial population of neurons throughout the brain could predict future choices, and their predictive activity was highly persistent in time. This showed that choices between conflicting needs did not occur at single moments of decision but rather reflected an ongoing goal-like state of the brain. Wanting to understand how this goal-like brain state shifted between hunger-motivated and thirst-motivated goals, I was inspired by a conceptual resemblance between my recorded neural data and the field of non-equilibrium statistical physics. Exploiting mathematical equations and physical insights from thermodynamics, I found, unexpectedly, that a few simple lines of math succinctly explained both behavioral and neural results and successfully predicted new results. This led me to propose a novel framework linking needs to behavior (and resolving \"Buridan's ass\"), in which needs indirectly and stochastically trap a global goal state into individual need-appropriate contexts.

{"title":"Specialized hardware-software systems for high-performance evolutionary and clinical genomics","abstract":"The landscape of computing has undergone a significant transformation with the death of Dennard scaling and the slowing of Moore's Law: applications now drive innovations in computer systems architecture. At the same time, the advent of high throughput, low cost sequencing technology has revolutionized genomics. The massive volume of data generated in genomics has revealed significant computational challenges in performing large-scale, sensitive biological inference, primarily due to the limitations of software designed for traditional multicore systems. Similarly, the existing downstream processing of genomic data from acutely ill patients contributes to delayed diagnostics, directly impacting the speed at which critical medical decisions can be made. To address this challenge, my research employs a hardware-software-algorithm co-design approach to significantly improve computational performance (scale, sensitivity, speed) in key areas of comparative and clinical genomics.   This dissertation presents systems that accelerate pipelines in both these domains of genomics. First, it describes SegAlign (GPU) and Darwin-WGA (FPGA/ASIC) cross-species whole genome alignment where co-design has yielded orders of magnitude increase in speed. Additionally, there are gains in accuracy while modifying the algorithm to improve the underlying hardware implementation. Next, it outlines the ultra-rapid nanopore whole genome sequencing pipeline that can deliver a genetic diagnosis in under 8 hours, making it the fastest pipeline to date. The scalable, cloud-based distributed infrastructure overcomes system bottlenecks to enable near real-time computation and improved variant identification. This pipeline has been deployed in critical care units in Stanford hospitals and applied to a cohort of multiple patients. Overall, these advancements not only redefine computational paradigms in genomics but also set a new standard for the integration of technological innovation in clinical settings, promising significant improvements in patient care and disease understanding.","vector":[-0.04266231879591942,-0.006574335973709822,-0.0656324103474617,-0.046673934906721115,-0.020470360293984413,-0.10113850980997086,-0.116097591817379,0.023232486099004745,-0.013327578082680702,-0.07126980274915695,-0.0602620467543602,-0.054169151932001114,-0.077961765229702,0.016195222735404968,-0.0645584911108017,0.007229086477309465,-0.050735846161842346,0.05675181746482849,-0.031345561146736145,-0.05022292211651802,-0.03489739075303078,0.0632469654083252,-0.021506521850824356,0.03317422419786453,-0.006530925165861845,-0.0025128163397312164,0.012112363241612911,0.009685511700809002,-0.006745828781276941,-0.032803718000650406,0.0865449458360672,0.033682044595479965,0.031187094748020172,0.046687912195920944,-0.0565834678709507,0.03157339245080948,-0.019066400825977325,-0.08945639431476593,0.05969399958848953,-0.06736785173416138,0.01739262230694294,0.04227973148226738,-0.016911925747990608,0.10501958429813385,0.056450944393873215,-0.02994479611515999,-0.04971121996641159,0.0677843689918518,0.04613667353987694,0.018512604758143425,-0.11676430702209473,-0.042128417640924454,-0.005594848655164242,0.06670945137739182,-0.03397684544324875,0.028490649536252022,0.04321058839559555,-0.07255300879478455,-0.0057071298360824585,-0.05734344571828842,0.014369389973580837,-0.13038165867328644,0.01938939280807972,0.013600777834653854,0.0013767125783488154,0.02893843501806259,0.125128373503685,-0.05697820335626602,0.04758176952600479,0.010328246280550957,-0.0015306960558518767,0.09326603263616562,0.004087671637535095,0.08192388713359833,-0.049223653972148895,0.06481786072254181,0.0029074454214423895,0.08589355647563934,0.057660654187202454,-0.09287936985492706,0.017443822696805,-0.04500027745962143,0.04831482470035553,-0.009620138444006443,0.05415980890393257,-0.04179731011390686,-0.026730483397841454,0.06990467756986618,-0.03426380828022957,0.00979059748351574,0.0012392362114042044,-0.051448822021484375,0.10609667003154755,-0.06536006927490234,0.057184360921382904,0.041574105620384216,0.04079309105873108,-0.018713271245360374,0.02589026466012001,-0.0060983519069850445,-0.07777824252843857,0.047050271183252335,0.06269508600234985,0.04964094236493111,0.05948784202337265,-0.05646651238203049,0.042172934859991074,0.0496063232421875,-0.01967758499085903,-0.032121844589710236,0.06167589873075485,0.06958211958408356,0.005609489977359772,0.040247008204460144,-0.0012388179311528802,0.0006163324578665197,-0.01980249397456646,0.03069746494293213,0.0334126278758049,0.10607139766216278,-0.0019490162376314402,-0.034128300845623016,-0.10189994424581528,-0.0019915325101464987,0.027186932042241096,0.07021111249923706,-0.07949310541152954,2.7817939732385043e-33,0.0046150763519108295,0.028140785172581673,0.07600673288106918,-0.027798408642411232,0.0008018346852622926,-0.07647068798542023,-0.002298130886629224,-0.01996111497282982,-0.09290929138660431,0.05810853838920593,-0.0748915746808052,0.03767362982034683,0.015285584144294262,0.0845046192407608,0.04254532977938652,-0.0491919219493866,-0.06463734060525894,0.03232463821768761,-0.054856158792972565,-0.0032222724985331297,0.035865046083927155,-0.01199954841285944,-0.024920079857110977,-0.06906908005475998,-0.019687844440340996,-0.014077262952923775,-0.04485391825437546,-0.045221421867609024,0.03560858219861984,0.013265919871628284,-0.08726639300584793,-0.028496665880084038,0.01885787770152092,0.0058747632429003716,0.08385724574327469,-0.02197200246155262,0.022555449977517128,-0.13916338980197906,0.05200755596160889,0.13915856182575226,0.011555280536413193,0.04553947597742081,0.03844136744737625,-0.04795892536640167,-0.04415150731801987,-0.032519660890102386,-0.021335145458579063,-0.019340336322784424,-0.06306084245443344,-0.003894619643688202,0.009462718851864338,0.02313806302845478,-0.0034011711832135916,-0.02963411621749401,-0.014342254027724266,-0.08541927486658096,-0.04286165535449982,0.000541394401807338,0.06270023435354233,0.13442742824554443,0.0036702293436974287,-0.027677232399582863,-0.02620147354900837,0.06391675025224686,-0.0030983046162873507,-0.0615607425570488,0.014901885762810707,0.04833628982305527,-0.02728973515331745,0.07094162702560425,0.014699380844831467,-0.047541551291942596,0.012026135809719563,-0.04322795942425728,-0.01161616574972868,0.045046642422676086,0.08054914325475693,-0.06554222851991653,-0.05244094505906105,-0.023979106917977333,-0.07883910089731216,0.1450209617614746,-0.0647687017917633,0.04216216504573822,-0.014641394838690758,-0.06051225960254669,-0.025421615689992905,0.03290577232837677,-0.0924493744969368,-0.02872852236032486,-0.04640371724963188,0.057319872081279755,0.06643401831388474,-0.030620742589235306,-0.039706502109766006,-3.175343053409075e-33,-0.03293681517243385,-0.06507924944162369,0.03622157871723175,0.0741250142455101,-0.00939212553203106,0.015330079011619091,0.018016846850514412,-0.08587323129177094,0.020960133522748947,-0.09659542143344879,0.023967575281858444,0.01641528308391571,0.040930379182100296,-0.03786488622

{"title":"Planning under uncertainty in safety-critical systems","abstract":"From warehouses and manufacturing lines to homes and offices, from roads and seas, to skies and space, autonomous systems promise to improve efficiency, unlock human potential, and explore new frontiers. Many autonomous systems already make decisions that impact our everyday lives. As technology continues to develop and the cost of compute continues to decrease, autonomous systems will continue integrating into society. However, a unifying necessity for safety-critical systems to deploy autonomously in the real world is the need to be able to reason about their environments and make good decisions to satisfy their objectives.   For autonomous systems to be deployed successfully, it often does not suffice to plan deterministically, that is, assuming that everything will `go as planned` against a single string of outcomes. Rather, agents must reason about the uncertainty that can arise, either from inexact actuation or sensing, imperfect information, unclear objectives, unknown motives of other participants, or complex environments. These sources of uncertainty can significantly complicate autonomous decision-making and can ultimately lead to catastrophic errors. By explicitly reasoning about these sources of uncertainty, this thesis introduces new methods for planning safely against them.   First, this thesis investigates methods that use data to overcome uncertainty in action outcomes and agent objectives. Specifically, we consider using human driving demonstrations alongside simulators to overcome objective uncertainty for autonomous driving in complex urban environments.  Previous approaches that used simulators to help imitate human driving were typically limited to relatively simple scenarios. We introduce Safety-Aware Hierarchical Adversarial Imitation Learning (SHAIL), a method that scales safety-critical data-driven decision-making to complex problems through reliance on hierarchical decomposition and safety predictions. After building a simulator to test counterfactuals of real-world driving decisions, we demonstrate empirically that SHAIL can improve safety compared to other data-driven decision-making methods, especially in unseen driving scenarios.    Next, we turn to safe planning under outcome and state uncertainty when models for those uncertainties are known a priori. Here, we impose safety through constraints on agent plans, modeling problems as constrained partially observable Markov decision processes (CPOMDPs). Approximate CPOMDP solutions are typically limited to small, discrete actions and observation spaces. We introduce algorithms that extend online search-based planning in CPOMDPs to domains with large or continuous state, action, and observation spaces by using methods that artificially limit the width of a search tree in unpromising areas and satisfy constraints using dual ascent. We empirically compare the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on continuous CPOMDPs that model both toy and real-world safety-critical problems. In doing so, we demonstrate that CPOMDP planning can be effective in continuous domains.   Unfortunately, the algorithms we introduce for safe online planning in continuous CPOMDPs are still restricted to relatively small problems. Fortunately, as noted for urban driving, many large planning problems can be decomposed hierarchically. In our final contribution, we introduce Constrained Options Belief Tree Search (COBeTS) to scale continuous CPOMDP planning to much larger problems with favorable hierarchical decompositions by planning over macro-actions (i.e. low-level controller options). We demonstrate COBeTS in several large, safety-critical, uncertain domains, showing that it can plan successfully while non-hierarchical baselines cannot. Importantly, we show that with constraint-satisfying macro-actions, COBeTS can guarantee safety regardless of planning time. In summary, our contributions improve planning safety in domains with quantifiable outcome, state, and/or objective uncertainty through novel applications of hierarchies and/or

{"title":"Writing and the origins of Greek intellectual influence","abstract":"Why is ancient Greek civilization considered the cradle of Western thought and intellectual practice? Although it is undeniably the Greeks who have shaped European and Western practice in science, mathematics, philosophy, historiography, and many other disciplines, the ancient Greeks themselves might have been surprised to find themselves occupying the role of \"founders of the Western tradition\" in lieu of their Near Eastern neighbors, to whom they credited the invention of many practices they pursued themselves, and with whom they had much fruitful intellectual exchange. Whereas it has traditionally been assumed that Greek thought became canonical in the West because of its inherent rationality, my dissertation argues that the outsize \"genetic success\" enjoyed in the West by Greek intellectual culture was the result of the emergence in Greece of an unusual literary culture, whose textual products proved uniquely capable of transmitting knowledge and practices across linguistic and cultural boundaries. Far from happening inevitably as the result of (e.g.) an alphabetic culture enabling rising literacy, this dissertation argues that this event required a series of extraordinary accidents to come about: namely, the return of writing technology to Greece from abroad, as opposed to its re-invention within Greece, after a lengthy period of illiteracy and low state development; and the emergence in the fifth century BCE of a political landscape which transformed various forms of knowledge and expertise into marketable commodities.","vector":[-0.027688832953572273,-0.011903582140803337,0.010021017864346504,-0.06062209978699684,-0.01480641309171915,-0.06139178201556206,0.04763006791472435,0.03801160305738449,-0.021959863603115082,0.0789155662059784,-0.0035904718097299337,0.11497777700424194,0.0037543256767094135,-0.001110520912334323,-0.02565828524529934,-0.019713522866368294,-0.12186851352453232,-0.03474763035774231,-0.04520807042717934,-0.0534294992685318,-0.020829718559980392,0.0022972021251916885,0.09345409274101257,0.05947248265147209,0.020517101511359215,0.045665010809898376,0.0296870619058609,-0.15599870681762695,0.020900435745716095,0.04413556307554245,-0.03085814043879509,0.08299201726913452,0.0009872724767774343,-0.07213234156370163,-0.035357922315597534,0.059051062911748886,0.04837239533662796,-0.03377550095319748,-0.014430603012442589,-0.07602158933877945,-0.0008127096807584167,-0.07174155861139297,0.036322180181741714,0.06258971244096756,-0.08711008727550507,0.050888705998659134,-0.00033806657302193344,0.07513976842164993,-0.06600907444953918,0.05504908040165901,-0.0377977080643177,-0.04354057461023331,0.010857031680643559,-0.11853709816932678,-0.0853058323264122,0.0418822281062603,0.04331596568226814,0.040959712117910385,-0.06919397413730621,-0.03686125576496124,-0.028815630823373795,-0.03560394421219826,-0.0027893970254808664,0.0022632693871855736,-0.08352457731962204,0.02709726244211197,0.03240976110100746,-0.02555146999657154,-0.075369693338871,-0.0017136370297521353,0.03174282982945442,-0.022345051169395447,-0.020397892221808434,0.026591960340738297,0.004833151586353779,0.020058831200003624,0.044227804988622665,-0.07419589906930923,-0.03642500564455986,-0.07279067486524582,0.10142073035240173,0.054008688777685165,0.03261983022093773,-0.027210889384150505,-0.07081534713506699,0.05057153105735779,-0.016360292211174965,-0.05262637138366699,0.09816513955593109,-0.09321349859237671,0.05977465957403183,-0.10532290488481522,0.02610078826546669,0.013176451437175274,0.08799325674772263,0.03552991524338722,-0.02945844456553459,-0.003406519303098321,0.04520399495959282,0.07804803550243378,0.04377635940909386,0.05069393292069435,0.029861722141504288,0.017059359699487686,-0.02038840390741825,-0.03889728710055351,-0.0412619411945343,-0.08429732173681259,-0.11030197888612747,0.01840948313474655,-0.07251418381929398,0.011582712642848492,0.05498509854078293,0.030592648312449455,0.027816584333777428,0.010700729675590992,0.01777583919465542,0.035891760140657425,0.06688269972801208,-0.06627081334590912,-0.030079903081059456,0.05146561563014984,-0.03122854419052601,0.022885439917445183,-0.023934245109558105,0.04153084009885788,-0.03199269622564316,1.561827916059725e-33,0.007298161741346121,0.02909289114177227,0.015429224818944931,0.06921730935573578,-0.04054071009159088,0.04015922173857689,0.0742381289601326,-0.05485479161143303,0.016725873574614525,-0.08275724947452545,-0.055950626730918884,0.029309505596756935,0.03977697342634201,0.014900275506079197,0.03981652855873108,0.0031844177283346653,0.04257944971323013,-0.03522501140832901,0.0322103276848793,0.05767066404223442,0.024660499766469002,0.014530074782669544,0.025782514363527298,-0.08192594349384308,-0.07053946703672409,0.045554615557193756,-0.04028835520148277,0.05238689109683037,-0.016252906993031502,0.0122526865452528,-0.031210148707032204,-0.07947442680597305,-0.025891201570630074,0.009690910577774048,0.01287734042853117,0.006716481409966946,0.01187061332166195,-0.06507996469736099,0.01119998563081026,-0.011199028231203556,-0.03528342396020889,0.07784507423639297,-0.03707295283675194,0.010805644094944,0.03724118322134018,0.017429595813155174,0.02060936763882637,-0.019219649955630302,-0.07432390749454498,-0.022731676697731018,-0.09221089631319046,0.0007520909421145916,0.0673103779554367,-0.0760769173502922,0.04963555186986923,0.008138421922922134,-0.020119231194257736,0.023656509816646576,0.014471991918981075,-0.04940566048026085,0.054589226841926575,0.07562342286109924,0.05358143895864487,0.03490675985813141,0.04036986082792282,0.06916430592536926,-0.001720869797281921,0.016935110092163086,0.024837875738739967,0.014478374272584915,0.057591285556554794,-0.05466463416814804,-0.08208203315734863,0.0065152933821082115,0.009255084209144115,0.07770876586437225,0.047569725662469864,-0.09145214408636093,-0.08811653405427933,0.022276002913713455,-0.07613035291433334,-0.03381524235010147,-0.08971747756004333,0.00510287145152688,0.04247785732150078,0.03942057117819786,0.048809804022312164,0.01580708660185337,0.07476718723773956,0.017470402643084526,-0.00853621494024992,-0.048586055636405945,0.05020202696323395,-0.015836991369724274,-0.05726515129208565,-4.395638432677077e-33,-0.028511717915534973,-0.04775198921561241,-0.07057712972164154,0.036929111927747726,-0.031148679554462433,-0.05930173397064209,-0.04737071692943573,0.0271836519241333,-0.038992177695035934,-0.03405937924981117,-0.033960890024900436,-0.04185647889971733,0.03127984330058098,-0.010760736651718616,0.0082518402

{"title":"The  role of TET1-mediated 5hmC in skeletal development and disease","abstract":"Cartilage, a mostly avascular tissue, is composed primarily of extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), in which resident cells, called chondrocytes, are embedded. Despite our knowledge about the biomechanical properties of cartilage, we still know relatively little about the identities of the chondrocytes embedded in the ECM matrix, and how they change with aging, injury, and chronic joint disease. The work described within this dissertation touches on two aspects of the molecular identities of these resident cells. First, in chapter 2, I describe work using cytometry by time-of-flight to characterize subpopulations of chondrocytes in human cartilage, and how these populations change with disease. I identify two new subpopulations, termed the Inflammation-Amplifying and Inflammation-Dampening cells, and demonstrate that drug modulations to their activities can alter disease progression. In chapters 3 and 4, the work switches to considering the epigenetic code that establishes cell identity. This work focuses on a chemical modification to the cytosine base, known as 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (or 5hmC), which marks the gene bodies of actively transcribed genes. In Chapter 3, I look at the role of this modification during cartilage development, and specifically how it primes the chromatin landscape for the transcription factor SOX9, allowing chondrocyte-specific genes to be expressed. In Chapter 4, I look at the role of 5hmc in disease progression of

{"title":"Modulation of muscle stem cell function through fasting","abstract":"Fasting is a dietary restriction paradigm that promotes stress resistance, modulates tissue function, and extends lifespan in a variety of organisms. Some of the benefits of fasting are attributed to its ability to influence stem cell function, though the effects of fasting on muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and muscle regeneration are unknown. Here, we show that fasting increases the depth of MuSC quiescence, driving them into a state of deep quiescence (DQ) that is characterized by heightened stress resistance and delayed cell cycle entry. While DQ is not conducive to rapid muscle repair, DQ MuSCs are resistant to apoptotic stimuli, including oxidative stress, irradiation, nutrient deprivation, and proliferative stress. DQ MuSCs also exhibit improved transplantation potency, reliably outcompeting co-transplanted MuSCs from ad lib fed animals in competitive transplantation assays. Mechanistically, induction of MuSC DQ is dependent on the nutrient- and stress- responsive mTORC1 pathway. Indeed, downregulation of mTORC1 is both necessary and sufficient for induction of DQ, as revealed by pharmacological and MuSC specific genetic manipulations. Furthermore, ketosis, a physiological adaptation to fasting, contributes to the effects of fasting on MuSCs. The ketone body β hydroxybutyrate (BHB) downregulates mTORC1 and drives DQ in MuSCs from fed animals in a p53 dependent manner. Indeed, pharmacological activation of p53 phenocopies the effects of BHB on MuSCs, and BHB-induced DQ is abrogated in MuSCs that lack p53. We conclude that the effects of exogenous ketosis derive from the established role of BHB as an endogenous histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, as pharmacological HDAC inhibition mimics the effects of fasting on MuSCs.

{"title":"Cytometric and genomic dissection of normal and neoplastic stem cell hierarchies","abstract":"Multicellular tissues are hierarchically organized into distinct cell types with intrinsic differences in function and developmental potential. Residing at the apex of this complex organization is the stem cell—the master orchestrator of tissue development, maintenance, and regeneration. Stem cells carry the unique property to indefinitely divide and differentiate into specialized cells. As best demonstrated in the blood system, a single hematopoietic (blood-forming) stem cell (HSC) can repopulate all the blood and immune cells of an organism. The regenerative potential of stem cells and their ability to become any cell type in the body has inspired numerous biological studies on how cell decisions are made and tissues are organized. These insights have influenced clinical applications in cell replacement therapy, disease modeling, and even the treatment of cancer, where stem cells that promote tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence can be targeted. Here, I describe the identification of stem cell populations in various normal and neoplastic tissues, including the mouse bone marrow, human skeleton, and human breast cancer. In the first part, I find a new marker expressed on the surface of mouse HSCs, Neogenin-1 (Neo1), that stratifies HSCs into two subpopulations—one that is more active and biased towards producing myeloid cells and another that is more dormant and capable of producing all blood lineages equally. Next, I demonstrate how analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing data from the human fetal growth plate enabled me to identify surface markers to isolate a highly regenerative population of human skeletal stem cells. Finally, I show how I leveraged a simple measure of transcriptional diversity in single-cell RNA-sequencing data to build a computational tool, CytoTRACE, that predicts the ordering of cells based on differentiation status and reveals genes associated with candidate human breast cancer stem cells. In summary, these studies highlight both functional and computational approaches for the identification of novel stem cell populations","vector":[-0.06797535717487335,-0.015539288520812988,-0.03662551939487457,-0.034162405878305435,0.014629049226641655,-0.019701050594449043,-0.004887972958385944,0.01796349138021469,0.020370885729789734,0.013503682799637318,-0.12873101234436035,0.016413051635026932,-0.06984582543373108,-0.03869793936610222,-0.03614446148276329,0.035365015268325806,-0.06780964136123657,0.04780668392777443,-0.035358987748622894,0.02976062148809433,-0.05039413645863533,-0.0700455829501152,0.018253082409501076,0.11092205345630646,0.005137556232511997,-0.07266011089086533,0.03392523154616356,0.07155340164899826,-0.060257911682128906,-0.01350430678576231,0.053194694221019745,-0.027159372344613075,0.04836390167474747,0.0633242055773735,-0.02578454278409481,-0.026720894500613213,0.026009052991867065,0.02900609001517296,-0.0818701833486557,0.015043281018733978,0.07628445327281952,-0.038165025413036346,-0.048660460859537125,0.057238008826971054,0.06971467286348343,-0.07609634101390839,-0.03523195907473564,-0.07809153944253922,0.0151738366112113,0.0557703822851181,0.026845958083868027,-0.000999772222712636,-0.030830107629299164,0.08894801884889603,-0.026741407811641693,0.0849369540810585,-0.0168251134455204,-0.017855390906333923,0.1077905222773552,-0.05320310220122337,-0.006048071663826704,-0.10394899547100067,0.011557044461369514,-0.02140776440501213,0.028488390147686005,-0.04605667293071747,0.034928031265735626,0.010409379377961159,-0.1081962138414383,-0.007212061434984207,0.051475007086992264,0.022391751408576965,0.002471949439495802,0.04729417338967323,-0.011711833998560905,0.02944578044116497,0.04575714096426964,0.08698821812868118,0.04606068879365921,0.03813792020082474,0.009111045859754086,0.06654229760169983,0.027654198929667473,0.03348736837506294,-0.021592166274785995,0.04694482311606407,-0.03866446018218994,0.058211106806993484,-0.036870118230581284,0.03155706450343132,-0.08881182223558426,0.041596103459596634,0.0652601569890976,0.0007734925602562726,-0.01588807813823223,0.058642249554395676,0.04137963429093361,0.014487864449620247,0.15960340201854706,-0.03339292109012604,0.004043716937303543,0.01645234413444996,0.033512067049741745,-0.02184806577861309,0.07105883955955505,-0.06754431128501892,-0.07694791257381439,0.039575304836034775,0.05405566468834877,-0.0019561767112463713,0.028804918751120567,-0.06396711617708206,-0.02161722630262375,0.09116145968437195,0.03666596859693527,0.06213444098830223,-0.004338379949331284,-0.03052164427936077,0.04028448462486267,0.02597961388528347,0.008002158254384995,-0.004528982564806938,0.08462806791067123,0.031043266877532005,0.00433752266690135,0.015153703279793262,-0.00982662569731474,2.3575473631914384e-34,0.06882360577583313,-0.004308517090976238,0.0751677006483078,0.09790342301130295,-0.01714240573346615,0.009391223080456257,-0.039965007454156876,-0.04992217198014259,-0.08086977154016495,0.016773665323853493,-0.03458170220255852,0.012619377113878727,0.033108290284872055,0.04495440796017647,-0.035875506699085236,-0.049669940024614334,-0.03000703826546669,-0.07816576957702637,-0.0716148167848587,-0.012304672040045261,-0.04266700521111488,0.037329986691474915,-0.02791605331003666,-0.058488309383392334,-0.04061976820230484,-0.010341859422624111,-0.07925153523683548,0.029757129028439522,0.007305945735424757,0.013432673178613186,-0.1069115400314331,0.005104019772261381,0.07493870705366135,-0.026127399876713753,-0.002079521305859089,-0.008592688478529453,-0.013291285373270512,-0.013965257443487644,0.025649061426520348,-0.03852010518312454,-0.023290731012821198,-0.06900423020124435,0.052321210503578186,-0.06896155327558517,0.03988545015454292,-0.06751202046871185,-0.08510082960128784,-0.08972717076539993,-0.031345341354608536,-0.018647879362106323,-0.014991295523941517,0.01772751472890377,0.0657702088356018,-0.01328262034803629,-0.07818347215652466,-0.029444903135299683,-0.08472681790590286,0.01678849197924137,-0.020986467599868774,0.061471886932849884,0.010719259269535542,-0.028752822428941727,-0.07368900626897812,0.15374408662319183,0.0602961890399456,0.040254853665828705,-0.014200348407030106,0.017506465315818787,-0.05001135542988777,0.02944234572350979,0.06861621141433716,-0.031031671911478043,0.06022171303629875,-0.042243391275405884,-0.014064967632293701,0.07110953330993652,0.05398164689540863,0.1414635330438614,-0.12827910482883453,0.05200113356113434,-0.04736052826046944,0.016521593555808067,-0.18399785459041595,0.015697231516242027,-0.029233857989311218,-0.05413789302110672,0.0048127188347280025,-0.06213800981640816,-0.002943974221125245,-0.04385695233941078,0.008865992538630962,-0.05843978747725487,-0.08082609623670578,-0.064723901450634,-0.037427838891744614,-4.422038933770592e-33,0.003031764179468155,0.019138382747769356,-0.016915876418352127,-0.049900975078344345,0.028190292418003082,0.06284850835800171,-0.014483232982456684,-0.01908000372350216,-0.03378269076347351,0.039149366319179535,0.05242413282394409,0.03545991703867912,-0.054812535643577576,-0.0017855585319921

{"title":"Characterizing cell-autonomous and non-autonomous contributions of RUNX1 loss in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis using genetically engineered primary human cells","abstract":"Disease-initiating mutations in the transcription factor RUNX1 occur as germline and somatic events that cause leukemias with particularly poor prognosis. However, the role of RUNX1 in leukemogenesis is not fully understood and effective therapies for RUNX1-mutant leukemias remain elusive. Here, we use primary patient samples and a RUNX1 knockout model in primary human hematopoietic cells to investigate how RUNX1 loss alters human hematopoietic develop and contributes to leukemic progression and to identify targetable vulnerabilities. RUNX1 loss expanded monocytic differentiation at the expense of erythro-megakaryocytic cells due to dysregulation of key transcription factors regulating erythro-megakaryocytic (GATA1, SRF) and myeloid (NFB) differentiation. Surprisingly, RUNX1 loss decreased proliferative capacity and stem cell function. However, RUNX1-deficient cells selectively upregulated the interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptor. Exposure to IL-3, but not other JAK/STAT cytokines, rescued RUNX1 KO proliferative and competitive defects. Further, we demonstrated that RUNX1 loss repressed JAK/STAT signaling and rendered RUNX1-deficient cells sensitive to JAK inhibitors.

{"title":"Understanding the role of skeletal stem cells in craniofacial and skeletal bone disease","abstract":"Craniofacial and skeletal bone disease, injury and impaired healing effects millions of individuals world-wide and represents a significant biomedical burden in the United States.  Craniofacial disease can manifest in significant developmental aberrancies impacting cognitive ability, facial structure and function resulting in significant reduction in quality of life if not treated. Likewise, non-union facture healing of the skeletal bone in the context of disease such as diabetes, arthritis and other various conditions, particularly in an aging population, represents an enormous clinical challenge. Both clinical and therapeutic advancements of bone regeneration have been impaired due to the lack of understanding of the cellular the molecular players driving development and regeneration in the craniofacial and skeletal bone compartments. The need for cellular and molecular therapeutics is ever more apparent in our current population.  Skeletal stem cells are a subset of cells found within the craniofacial and skeletal bone compartments. These multipotent cell types reside in these compartments with the purpose of coordinating development and healing of bony tissue. Skeletal stem cells are multipotent in nature, with the potential to differentiate into bone, cartilage and supporting stromal tissue. Since the initial concept of a skeletal stem cells was proposed, several groups have identified various multipotent, self-renewing cell types in bone compartments, gaining the title of skeletal stem cells, yet much is to be debated on the identity of a skeletal stem cells. Nevertheless, several groups have suggested the critical role of skeletal stem cells populations in craniofacial and skeletal bone development, disease and regeneration. With this motivation, we sought to better understand from a cellular and molecular perspective the role of skeletal stem cells in the craniofacial disease, Craniosynostosis and the skeletal long bone disease Marfan syndrome.  Chapter I presents a comparative analysis between mouse and human calvarial vault. The vertebrate calvarial vault is an ancient and highly conserved structure across species, however the mechanisms governing osteogenesis of the calvarial vault and how they might be conserved across mammalian species remains unclear.  The aim of chapter I is to determine if regional differences in osteogenic potential of the calvarial vault, first described in mice, extend to human. Human frontal and parietal osteoblasts were derived from fetal calvarial tissue, demonstrating enhanced osteogenic potential both in-vitro and in-vivo of human frontal derived osteoblasts compared to parietal derived osteoblasts. Furthermore, we found shared differential signaling patterns in the canonical WNT, TGF-β, BMP and FGF pathways previously described in the mouse to govern these regional differences in osteogenic potential. Taken together, our findings unveil evolutionary conserved similarities both at a functional and molecular level between the mouse and human calvarial bones, providing further support that studies employing mouse models, are suitable for translational studies to human. Chapter II presents a study which investigates whether the Mouse Skeletal Stem Cell (mSSC) is resident in the cranial sutures. Cranial sutures are major growth centers for the calvarial vault, and their premature fusion leads to a pathologic condition called craniosynostosis, one of the more common craniofacial developmental diseases. Prospective isolation by FACS identified mSSCs within the cranial sutures with a significant difference in spatio-temporal representation between fusing and patent sutures. Transcriptomic analysis highlighted a distinct signature in mSSCs-derived from the physiological closing PF suture, and single cell RNA sequencing identifies transcriptional heterogeneity among the PF, SAG and COR sutures, suggestive of mSSC subpopulations transcriptionally primed for bone or cartilage fate. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling increases mSSCs representation in the sutures, conversely, inhibition decreases the mSSC representation within the cranial suture. With this in mind, crossing an Axin2LacZ/+ mouse, endowed with enhanced Wnt activation, to a Twist1+/− mouse model of coronal craniosynostosis, enriches mSSC population resident in the coronal suture, in effect restoring patency. Finally, co-transplantation of mSSCs with recombinant Wnt3a prevents resynostosis following suturectomy in Twist1+/− mice. This study reveals that a decrease and/or imbalance of skeletal stem cells representation within the cranial sutures may underlie craniosynostosis providing translational implications toward therapeutic approaches for craniosynostosis. Chapter III presents a study describing a cranial suture explant culture method that can be applied wildly to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cranial suture biology. Craniofacial research approaches multiple facets of basic science spanning from molecular regulation of craniofacial development, cell biology/signaling and ultimately translational craniofacial biology. Cranial sutures coordinate development of the skull, and the premature fusion of one or more, leads to craniosynostosis. With limited access to human samples and particular the lack of non-disease controls, animal models provide significant contributions toward craniofacial biology and many clinical/surgical treatments of craniofacial disorders. However, studies employing mouse models are costly and time consuming due to housing, breeding and variability of the in-vivo context.  Here, we present the establishment of a cranial suture explant 2-D culture method that has shown fidelity in comparison to in-vivo isolations procedures, allowing for isolation of high yields of skeletal stem and progenitor cells from small number of mice. Moreover, this method allows the opportunity for specific genetic manipulations, phenocoping models of craniosynostosis in-vitro. Additionally, this model allows for in-vitro tamoxifen-induction of Cre based reporter systems, an example being the ActinCreERT2; R26Rainbow mouse often utilized to trace clonal expansion. This versatile method tackles needs of large number of mice to perform cranial suture research.   Finally, Chapter IV represents a study on Marfan Syndrome (MFS), an autosomal dominant disease affecting approximately 10,000 individuals worldwide. MFS manifests in 3 different systems: skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular. Chapter IV presents a study focused on the effects of MFS on the skeletal system, commonly characterized by overgrowth of the endochondral long bones using a mouse model. The Fibrillin-1+\\- mouse is a model of MFS displaying some of the hallmark characteristics of over-growth and reduced bone volume in the endochondral long bones. Given the shared skeletal phenotype in MFS human patients and Fbn1+/- mouse, we hypothesized that these skeletal abnormalities would correlate to perturbed skeletal stem cells function, through dysregulation of the TGFB pathway. Here we demonstrate that mouse skeletal stem cell (mSSC) derived from Fbn-1+/- mice growth plates have increased activation of TGFB resulting in impaired differentiation capacity, producing smaller bone nodules and significantly reduced mineralization in-vitro. These findings suggest that the targeted inhibition of TGFB signaling in mSSCs might provide potential therapeutic approach to treating the skeletal effects of MFS. The findings stemming from this study not only provide potential insight into mitigation for improper bone development and healing in MFS patients but also in several bone pathologies related to

{"title":"Multi-omics studies of aging and neurodegenerative disease in human cohorts","abstract":"Aging is the number one risk factor for everything from heart disease to cancer to broken bones to neurodegeneration. The molecular details of how aging drives such diverse disease processes are still largely unknown. A critical limitation to such study in humans is the lack of reliable molecular biomarkers of aging in different organs. This is a particularly severe problem for the brain and the study of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, the two most common forms of neurodegeneration, where damage is thought to accumulate silently for many years before symptoms emerge. This dissertation is focused on the question of biomarkers for aging generally and on early biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease in particular. Here, I take a data-driven approach to the discovery of new biomarkers using biofluid proteomics, the quantitative analysis of thousands of proteins in plasma, cerebral spinal fluid, and urine. In Chapter 1, I give a general overview of the fields of biomarkers for aging and neurodegeneration, with a focus on data-driven and machine-learning approaches. Chapter 2 presents a machine-learning approach to the development of organ-specific biomarkers of aging using plasma proteomics from thousands of people across the adult lifespan. We create biomarkers for 11 different organs which can be used to predict future health and disease outcomes, and we do a deep dive into how the aging of different organs contributes to Alzheimer's disease onset, progression, and general cognitive decline. Chapter 3 presents the discovery and characterization of a new molecular biomarker of Parkinson's disease using cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and urine proteomics. This biomarker, AADC, can predict disease onset before symptoms appear and can predict future disease progression, two urgently unmet needs in the field of Parkinson's disease research and clinical care. Together, these studies demonstrate the power of data-driven proteomics for biomarker research in aging and neurodegeneration, and provide analytical frameworks and large resources of human data for future study.","vector":[-0.04687729477882385,-0.08664023131132126,0.006349408533424139,-0.007529813330620527,0.07729268074035645,0.038285549730062485,-0.022939393296837807,0.08456623554229736,-0.04705880209803581,-0.0473492369055748,-0.04185197502374649,-0.008058139123022556,-0.006322624161839485,0.05743065103888512,-0.08993522077798843,0.06978896260261536,-0.1346072256565094,0.019861701875925064,0.007599724922329187,-0.037662211805582047,0.029682105407118797,0.012796412222087383,-0.016429593786597252,0.05029306560754776,0.010051856748759747,-0.006448510102927685,0.04415955767035484,-0.04319881647825241,-0.07471027970314026,0.09545280039310455,0.11121859401464462,-0.03736423701047897,-0.03066996857523918,0.017228538170456886,-0.02886894717812538,0.025106849148869514,-0.05022739991545677,9.281047823606059e-05,-0.0760079100728035,-0.026774583384394646,0.03585761785507202,-0.054787829518318176,-0.03905627503991127,-0.026637261733412743,0.10670217126607895,0.03452226147055626,0.02606143057346344,-0.05119362846016884,0.03125955909490585,0.06527942419052124,-0.03197656571865082,-0.02270752564072609,-0.04212860390543938,0.052225515246391296,-0.019691022112965584,0.016802717000246048,-0.007461403496563435,-0.08647605776786804,-0.03230876848101616,-0.004343780688941479,-0.04332766681909561,-0.08092869073152542,0.01993483304977417,-0.05927974358201027,0.029162060469388962,-0.03075181320309639,0.07737826555967331,0.017834516242146492,-0.10555331408977509,0.0027556230779737234,-0.07302799820899963,0.05641656368970871,0.0020166372414678335,0.0977054014801979,-0.00882738921791315,0.0178956538438797,-0.0685625821352005,-0.024934902787208557,0.010051555000245571,-0.1536155343055725,0.049487221986055374,0.027657127007842064,0.06148843467235565,0.0837445929646492,0.11953884363174438,0.0071515878662467,0.015378952026367188,0.1307663768529892,-0.06346802413463593,0.02926516719162464,0.01961483247578144,-0.004216354340314865,0.029545284807682037,0.028435438871383667,0.003327649552375078,0.03483495116233826,-0.018347473815083504,-0.02761516533792019,0.038048792630434036,0.005585497710853815,-0.136037215590477,0.004382523242384195,0.014577221125364304,-0.02133396454155445,0.006356724072247744,0.0485193245112896,0.01785534992814064,0.07301098853349686,0.05898665636777878,0.06486419588327408,0.07280188798904419,-0.016720479354262352,-0.024476896971464157,0.051787979900836945,0.03551725670695305,-0.027105100452899933,-0.05705258622765541,0.005554410628974438,0.062216609716415405,0.07256116718053818,-0.024032335728406906,-0.0026548574678599834,0.018194833770394325,0.07115247845649719,-0.019296644255518913,0.07362343370914459,-0.02757837437093258,3.351802020540778e-33,0.02969193086028099,-0.03568777069449425,0.006103564519435167,0.020392021164298058,-0.032947883009910583,-0.0541677325963974,-0.06805088371038437,-0.05981329083442688,0.05341647192835808,0.005287980195134878,-0.005056277383118868,-0.04383267089724541,-0.023925796151161194,-0.007602280471473932,-0.017589537426829338,0.037485767155885696,-0.04738706350326538,-0.008049358613789082,0.013854851014912128,-0.08457555621862411,0.01914544403553009,-0.014642879366874695,-0.011389756575226784,-0.026544542983174324,0.023846978321671486,-0.04591292887926102,-0.08132516592741013,0.06103963777422905,-0.02205689623951912,-0.020848050713539124,-0.08483508974313736,-0.06564933061599731,-0.04165014252066612,-0.0025067313108593225,-0.004607717040926218,-0.014809176325798035,0.03427679464221001,-0.012686420232057571,-0.03876936435699463,0.06100550666451454,-0.006123358849436045,-0.058159828186035156,0.017060626298189163,-0.07739230990409851,-0.02888621762394905,-0.03450881317257881,0.030944738537073135,-0.013754206709563732,-0.012310336343944073,-0.06138718128204346,0.01776985637843609,-0.03739533945918083,-0.00721992552280426,0.01286925096064806,-0.12630242109298706,0.006032800301909447,-0.07799048721790314,-0.03490820527076721,0.05922883003950119,0.015731489285826683,0.03840045630931854,0.024948207661509514,-0.03503893315792084,0.01617792434990406,0.0008368570124730468,0.007045661099255085,-0.010038943961262703,0.0022923338692635298,0.007819713093340397,0.046160563826560974,0.04746439307928085,0.0028909810353070498,0.0632983073592186,-0.043093834072351456,-0.016407769173383713,0.028056269511580467,0.052629824727773666,0.030442288145422935,-0.08325301110744476,0.022219423204660416,0.026087621226906776,-0.01717120222747326,-0.10572678595781326,0.04654635861515999,0.011767569929361343,0.030713655054569244,0.058915529400110245,-0.057099681347608566,-0.06337478011846542,-0.06893084198236465,-0.06758894771337509,-0.04301782697439194,0.022287296131253242,-0.02231575921177864,-0.06425735354423523,-5.406820346431502e-33,-0.04759373515844345,-0.008009088225662708,0.10590671747922897,0.029688464477658272,0.0509573370218277,0.02527502365410328,-0.043891098350286484,0.010986975394189358,0.043123021721839905,-0.09398571401834488,0.038637030869722366,-0.02232075110077858,0.03440321236848831,-0.0232629068195819

{"title":"Essays on efficiency, fairness, and incentives in resource allocation","abstract":"This dissertation consists of three essays on efficiency, fairness, and incentives in resource allocation. Chapter 2 studies allocation problems with and without monetary transfers, such as multi-unit auctions, school choice, and course assignment. For this class of problems, we introduce a generalized random priority mechanism with budgets (GRP). This mechanism is always ex post incentive compatible and feasible. Moreover, as the market grows large, this mechanism can approximate any incentive compatible mechanism in the corresponding continuum economy. In particular, GRP can be used to approximate efficient and envy-free allocations, while preserving incentive compatibility and feasibility. Chapter 3, a joint work with Daisuke Hirata, Onur Kesten, Morimitsu Kurino, and M. Utku Ünver, studies the problem of assigning a set of indivisible objects to a set of agents when monetary transfers are not allowed and agents reveal only ordinal preferences, but random assignments are possible. We offer two characterizations of the probabilistic serial mechanism, which assigns lotteries over objects. We show that it is the only mechanism satisfying non-wastefulness and ordinal fairness and the only mechanism satisfying sd-efficiency, sd-envy-freeness, and weak invariance or weak truncation robustness (where \"sd\" stands for first-order stochastic dominance). Chapter 4 studies equilibrium selection and stability in the generalized second price auction used by major search engines to sell advertisement slots. We assume that a bidder who bids randomly (noise bidder) participates in the auction with a small probability. The main finding is that the VCG-equivalent equilibria, considered plausible in this literature, do not survive in this model, even as the probability that the noise bidder appears converges to 0. An efficient equilibrium is essentially unique if it exists. This equilibrium is further justified in a model without the noise bidder as a unique limit of efficient trembling-hand perfect equilibria in which all bidders make mistakes in similar ways. However, the noise-bidder model may not have any efficient equilibrium, or even any pure strategy equilibrium.

{"title":"Landscapes of inequality : social differentiation in geometric through classical crete","abstract":"Traditional histories of the Greek world in the first millennium BCE characterize Crete as an unusual region, where a seventh-century floruit was followed by the emergence of economically stagnant, oligarchic city-states. This dissertation takes an archaeological approach to understanding inequality and social difference in Cretan communities in the 8th through the 4th centuries BCE, one that moves beyond literary accounts to focus on the material culture of rural settlements recovered by archaeological surveys. I first critique some of the ways that archaeologists have approached inequality in the past and demonstrate why we need a new approach. I discuss how interpretations of survey evidence have traditionally been deployed in arguments about inequality and complexity and argue that we can extract more information from this evidence than has been previously attempted. My own methods combine spatial and functional analysis of settlement patterns across the island with in-depth study of small regions. I demonstrate that there are meaningful differences between small survey sites on Crete, with some sites more engaged in agricultural intensification, large-scale storage, elaborate dining practices, or trade than others. This is important, for it suggests that we cannot interpret all small settlements as single-family farmsteads of equal means occupied year-round. The Cretan evidence thus encourages us to consider alternatives to models of Greek land use and community organization predicated a middle class of small freeholding citizen farmers -- a narrative that has dominated the interpretation of evidence from archaeological surveys on the Greek mainland and has had broad implications for discussions of Greek egalitarianism in general. The dissertation concludes with a reflection on how Cretan communities used material culture to send messages about individual and collective identity, with particular focus on the phenomena of \"austerity\" and \"conservatism\" in Cretan material culture.","vector":[-0.010904243215918541,0.06622157990932465,0.0401180200278759,-0.025242578238248825,0.01317090354859829,-0.05930563807487488,-0.07589825987815857,-0.027144307270646095,-0.07399293780326843,0.06137597933411598,0.008495046757161617,-0.0623285248875618,-0.009296397678554058,0.07551130652427673,-0.005617632530629635,-0.028899263590574265,-0.050083935260772705,0.019212212413549423,0.022852687165141106,0.009051777422428131,-0.02513246051967144,-0.010149560868740082,0.05422374978661537,0.05719393864274025,0.06823725998401642,-0.07304272055625916,0.04001322016119957,-0.04624228551983833,0.01231245044618845,0.03632514923810959,-0.01930997148156166,0.1301492303609848,0.0644330307841301,-0.006695827003568411,0.006940120365470648,0.10426198691129684,0.07022968679666519,-0.04559069871902466,-0.0180364903062582,-0.04644392803311348,-0.022212935611605644,0.016629798337817192,0.08157801628112793,-0.0648532435297966,-0.12675511837005615,0.037631675601005554,0.08444591611623764,-0.05029098689556122,-0.06427823007106781,-0.012803195975720882,0.06628692150115967,0.04667140170931816,-0.00032075686613097787,-0.07728450000286102,-0.08632119745016098,0.035980481654405594,-0.006426739506423473,-0.04502398520708084,0.013066901825368404,-0.07959595322608948,0.04127819091081619,0.0025904036592692137,-0.021794985979795456,-0.003940095659345388,-0.03882363811135292,0.003306769533082843,-0.02542475424706936,0.004021818749606609,-0.0831378623843193,0.020381148904561996,0.01001758873462677,-0.03143693506717682,-0.013191679492592812,-0.03060789406299591,0.021431343629956245,-0.060930103063583374,-0.011207672767341137,-0.03014599345624447,-0.07214599847793579,-0.07574333995580673,0.026963796466588974,0.018467677757143974,0.03530045971274376,-0.04205186665058136,-0.06761854141950607,0.05104291811585426,0.02133207768201828,-0.049571000039577484,0.13695786893367767,-0.06805234402418137,0.05983877182006836,0.015180624090135098,0.012692460790276527,-0.05881250649690628,0.10400526225566864,0.0007996291387826204,-0.034305281937122345,0.0181948971003294,0.04045303910970688,0.10260310024023056,0.049140337854623795,0.024595340713858604,0.021074047312140465,-0.01947193406522274,-0.024986507371068,-0.036729227751493454,-0.06417378038167953,-0.057087771594524384,-0.03760762885212898,0.10969012975692749,-0.01840800978243351,-0.015615723095834255,0.01176289189606905,0.029390525072813034,0.013316660188138485,0.004255774896591902,0.03530510514974594,-0.012612593360245228,0.03364771977066994,-0.013902788981795311,0.03021194599568844,-0.013888214714825153,-0.042370863258838654,-0.00260366965085268,0.07957848161458969,0.11292428523302078,0.005226705688983202,4.0914957997911186e-33,0.010259419679641724,-0.034771356731653214,0.01804153248667717,0.03778199106454849,0.04966352507472038,0.004318727646023035,-0.03510952368378639,-0.025847041979432106,0.047686103731393814,0.0001374374405713752,-0.0066524590365588665,0.03529377654194832,0.006641359068453312,-0.03584720939397812,0.07886896282434464,0.03608732298016548,-0.026085639372467995,-0.05867067724466324,0.02992125041782856,0.007542146369814873,-0.04811693727970123,-0.09322641789913177,0.03634308651089668,0.007049029227346182,-0.06220715865492821,-0.04654062166810036,0.03576746582984924,0.03391746059060097,-0.031523577868938446,-0.025288792327046394,-0.00863978173583746,-0.04772289842367172,0.0407901257276535,-0.012753305025398731,0.005411940161138773,0.024147557094693184,0.03760601580142975,-0.08927973359823227,-0.027129225432872772,-0.003948868252336979,-0.09062153846025467,-0.022860947996377945,0.0418221652507782,-0.01890861615538597,0.034814730286598206,-0.007821417413651943,0.0528622530400753,0.029601847752928734,-0.06405027210712433,0.04252036288380623,-0.010694789700210094,0.046073317527770996,-0.015790734440088272,-0.06625839322805405,-0.046735141426324844,-0.0029658463317900896,-0.03687597066164017,-0.02249239757657051,0.01898135058581829,0.023540209978818893,0.04075561836361885,-0.024121180176734924,0.12254305183887482,-0.022946691140532494,0.015482978895306587,0.09166406840085983,-0.012250017374753952,0.0716388002038002,0.046656373888254166,0.0027567357756197453,0.02094339393079281,-0.03869670256972313,-0.035135071724653244,0.05119815096259117,0.05656035989522934,0.05784925818443298,0.03824666887521744,0.013320556841790676,-0.05504938215017319,-0.00850682146847248,-0.04204237461090088,-0.08995401114225388,-0.09145785123109818,0.045778803527355194,-0.00045296733151189983,-0.06053448095917702,0.07170096784830093,-0.03185392543673515,0.15079399943351746,-0.028757886961102486,-0.03421523794531822,-0.04395638778805733,-0.01687047816812992,-0.016671746969223022,-0.03560502454638481,-5.0416600058462665e-33,-0.07018288969993591,-0.013628964312374592,-0.04246000945568085,-0.018275683745741844,-0.07566912472248077,-0.10806511342525482,-0.032187093049287796,-0.06103914603590965,0.022444570437073708,-0.04403501749038696,-0.09987321496009827,0.0359664112329483,0.10057298839092255,-0.05446524173021

{"title":"Partial reprogramming of the aging neurogenic niche as a potential rejuvenation strategy","abstract":"Aging is associated with a decline in function of cells and tissues, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the incidence of many diseases including neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. Importantly, the accumulation of age-associated changes is not inevitable. Understanding how to slow down or potentially even reverse the process of aging in different cell types is critical to the goal of preserving tissue function and organism health during aging. One interesting strategy to reverse aging is reprogramming, through the forced expression of the Yamanaka reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC (OSKM). Reprogramming of somatic cells by constant expression of OSKM results in embryonic stem cell-like cells and erases many hallmarks of aging in vitro. However, the impact of OSKM expression on cell function and heterogeneity in specific cell types in old animals is not fully known. In this dissertation, I present my work on aging and reprogramming. First, I discuss several categories of rejuvenation strategies that have recently been studied in mice, including soluble blood factors, manipulation of diet and metabolism, killing of senescent cells, and reprogramming. Next, I explore how partial reprogramming affects the subventricular zone (SVZ), a conserved neurogenic niche in mammalian brains. Partial reprogramming, achieved by expression OSKM in a time- or cell-restricted manner, has been shown to improve function in a variety of cell types from aging mice without permanent loss of cell identity. But the impact of partial reprogramming on the aging brain is largely unknown. I focus on the SVZ, a neurogenic niche which holds intrinsic regenerative potential, as neural stem cells from the SVZ can give rise to newborn neurons and astrocytes throughout adulthood. Lastly, I examine the impact of aging and heterogeneity on reprogramming of fibroblasts, the most commonly used cell type for reprogramming to pluripotency. Together, these studies demonstrate the complex interplay between aging and reprogramming, and the potential for reprogramming to be applied as a tool to counteract age-related decline.","vector":[-0.03505117818713188,-0.007620200514793396,-0.004719185177236795,0.021434050053358078,-0.027147812768816948,0.03464692458510399,-0.0311571154743433,-0.01225254312157631,-0.045333895832300186,0.03891443833708763,0.001051184837706387,0.05835418403148651,-0.033633340150117874,-0.0025643587578088045,-0.04478266462683678,0.08915584534406662,-0.04877113550901413,0.17025253176689148,-0.067470021545887,-0.006386259570717812,0.011124839074909687,-0.048013560473918915,0.009289847686886787,0.001996916951611638,0.014617332257330418,-0.012403500266373158,-0.06365630030632019,0.021867386996746063,-0.026196105405688286,-0.0598173551261425,0.03579752892255783,0.09249015152454376,-0.008453205227851868,-0.023665061220526695,-0.05355700105428696,0.043252866715192795,-0.001960146939381957,-0.027924932539463043,-0.059076808393001556,0.03982607275247574,0.030806636437773705,-0.056938596069812775,-0.07657361775636673,0.04251889884471893,0.058053500950336456,-0.07653723657131195,-0.029860271140933037,-0.04013773798942566,-0.028620924800634384,0.03487258031964302,-0.02452656999230385,-0.0790787860751152,-0.0787845030426979,0.061783287674188614,-0.002918332116678357,0.023647574707865715,-0.03371260315179825,0.011054123751819134,0.03592613711953163,0.003658924251794815,0.009813323616981506,-0.09244358539581299,0.01687638834118843,-0.04064420610666275,-0.0058700162917375565,-0.06472381204366684,0.03505169227719307,-0.033954836428165436,-0.06440537422895432,0.035975053906440735,0.022784918546676636,-0.03292928263545036,0.052857302129268646,0.070350781083107,-0.012601803056895733,-0.03799734264612198,-0.03514746576547623,0.00803154706954956,0.030928248539566994,-0.06384646147489548,0.07199367135763168,0.029392164200544357,0.02400432713329792,0.04270307719707489,0.017557859420776367,-0.03619982302188873,-0.0027905250899493694,0.05061393603682518,-0.002632883610203862,0.06778175383806229,0.030314836651086807,0.020646972581744194,0.05590025335550308,-0.036562565714120865,0.018598109483718872,-0.006314478814601898,0.02362954057753086,-0.002591270487755537,0.05108557268977165,-0.014173423871397972,-0.057269442826509476,0.016046790406107903,0.0051147229969501495,-0.008117561228573322,0.009171037934720516,-0.007242962718009949,-0.06402614712715149,0.05012749508023262,-0.02264866791665554,0.08727730065584183,0.03030374087393284,0.00776647636666894,-0.040986306965351105,0.10699034482240677,0.001279159914702177,0.0743420422077179,-0.034577108919620514,0.010569768957793713,0.03580300137400627,-0.0020085738506168127,0.012052414007484913,0.002729657804593444,0.03492209315299988,-0.001364604919217527,-0.04494631662964821,0.09321381151676178,0.06479259580373764,2.7880582561024332e-33,0.04319213703274727,-0.014460809528827667,-0.09524077922105789,0.021749448031187057,-0.012994438409805298,-0.08683828264474869,-0.03646264225244522,-0.013435915112495422,-0.05902526155114174,0.0005605999031104147,0.02802233025431633,0.02019542269408703,-0.0026976705994457006,0.016380686312913895,0.005567509680986404,0.015285445377230644,-0.06205959618091583,-0.021060761064291,0.04473402351140976,-0.04854363203048706,0.07204395532608032,-0.01308033149689436,-0.08088263124227524,-0.04016074165701866,0.018276162445545197,-0.05402755364775658,-0.006213868502527475,-0.018093617632985115,9.599761142453644e-06,-0.011594481766223907,-0.04388728737831116,-0.01586923934519291,-0.0018571073887869716,-0.08102397620677948,-0.007872075773775578,-0.067684605717659,0.013337463140487671,-0.0594906322658062,0.009333990514278412,0.006842446513473988,-0.02037873864173889,-0.019279954954981804,-0.03605467453598976,-0.09263808280229568,0.046758245676755905,-0.09419483691453934,0.020502686500549316,0.021781666204333305,0.017643006518483162,-0.020261282101273537,0.05228617414832115,0.02212839014828205,0.02242378517985344,0.008880197070538998,-0.0948471650481224,-0.02276027575135231,-0.08073806017637253,-0.029975688084959984,-0.03939829021692276,0.027181144803762436,-0.009249635972082615,-0.03161245211958885,-0.010608023032546043,0.07876456528902054,0.04770258814096451,0.013377049937844276,-0.06284906715154648,-0.062202271074056625,-0.04558582976460457,0.07305049896240234,0.03235691040754318,-0.10629604756832123,0.02200433239340782,-0.05248487368226051,-0.02405695430934429,-0.03250858560204506,0.11179141700267792,0.11812327802181244,-0.08603306859731674,-0.0019402571488171816,0.07074765115976334,0.07877267897129059,-0.20759820938110352,0.07422349601984024,0.08600027114152908,-0.07105011492967606,-0.004665483720600605,-0.0758921429514885,-0.010450677014887333,-0.004224981646984816,0.01645849645137787,-0.10431727766990662,-0.014619393274188042,-0.05657675862312317,-0.017909467220306396,-5.291033050849553e-33,0.028444034978747368,-0.04011748731136322,0.032650500535964966,0.03804600238800049,0.004116110969334841,0.05633522570133209,-0.019682010635733604,0.03684598580002785,0.012110374867916107,-0.08697162568569183,0.027907108888030052,0.0039706300012767315,0.014870971441268921,0.0

{"title":"Essays on information transmission","abstract":"This dissertation comprises three essays in information economics. The central focus of this work is to study how the structure of the informational environment impacts the transmission of information and the resultant effects on outcomes and welfare. The first chapter of this dissertation introduces a new framework for modeling strategic information transmission in complex environments. We identify an equilibrium that is efficient and sender-optimal. The outcome is exactly what the sender would choose if she held full decision-making authority. This contrasts with the canonical simple environment of Crawford and Sobel (1982) in which equilibrium outcomes are inefficient and favor the receiver. The second chapter explores how an expert's ability to persuade changes with the availability of messages. We develop a geometric representation of the expert's payoff when using a limited number of messages. We identify bounds on the value of an additional signal for the sender. Moreover, we show that an additional signal does not directly translate into more information in equilibrium, and the receiver might prefer coarse communication. This suggests that regulations on communication capacity have the potential to shift the balance of power from the expert to the decision-maker, ultimately improving welfare. The third chapter deviates from the preceding two by focusing on non-strategic communication. In this chapter, we introduce a model in which homophily affects both the quality and diversity of the information to which people have access in their social networks. We characterize conditions under which homophily hurts rather than helps social learning. Homophily lowers efficiency and increases inequality in sparse networks but enhances efficiency and decreases inequality in dense enough networks. We also show that optimal (learning-maximizing) networks exhibit assortativity in payoff-determining characteristics, which results in incidental homophily on other innate characteristics, providing an explanation for some empirical patterns.","vector":[0.01138045359402895,-0.015050576999783516,-0.011703625321388245,-0.024643471464514732,0.006843009497970343,-0.08103808015584946,0.10160379856824875,0.08235389739274979,0.08438801765441895,0.07286158949136734,-0.06931167840957642,0.030235281214118004,0.060310181230306625,-0.008464820683002472,0.015675636008381844,-0.006341277156025171,0.11022375524044037,-0.006035297643393278,-0.0777745395898819,-0.005575021728873253,0.05524028465151787,-0.05113536864519119,0.06406927108764648,-0.0007260110578499734,-0.0224942434579134,-0.0802670270204544,-0.0234678965061903,-0.005891470238566399,-0.05676059052348137,-0.06799442321062088,-0.024238059297204018,0.005224769003689289,0.10514271259307861,-0.00730639835819602,-0.10435404628515244,0.02598445490002632,-0.01468104962259531,0.030224770307540894,-0.03814595192670822,0.06284802407026291,-0.0043038190342485905,-0.014480791985988617,-0.07267735153436661,0.05272727832198143,-0.04136370122432709,0.015080142766237259,0.10231699794530869,0.07773825526237488,-0.019723067060112953,-0.008599073626101017,-0.08443518728017807,-0.020738236606121063,-0.025084372609853745,0.017062021419405937,0.005277525167912245,-0.022579899057745934,-0.0011522104032337666,0.026342447847127914,0.006511565297842026,0.016824789345264435,0.0159272700548172,-0.04428339749574661,-0.06294171512126923,-0.044790443032979965,0.04881011322140694,-0.030471837148070335,-0.0017889951122924685,0.06001186743378639,-0.09098058193922043,0.027464210987091064,0.026797937229275703,-0.03657510131597519,-0.06449884921312332,-0.06592793017625809,0.03519996255636215,-0.12483642995357513,0.006573047023266554,0.07393477112054825,0.02155054546892643,0.04319467768073082,-0.02528230845928192,-0.014082157053053379,-0.05963468551635742,0.035546500235795975,-0.03265589103102684,-0.10169345885515213,-0.04970256984233856,0.012190120294690132,0.1843041479587555,-0.08587358146905899,-0.057639654725790024,-0.0046592094004154205,0.008081942796707153,0.051622193306684494,0.0561487153172493,0.040514908730983734,-0.00789578352123499,-0.05158958584070206,-0.012908751145005226,0.11304007470607758,0.005954639054834843,-0.06155567243695259,-0.004322113003581762,-0.02900053560733795,-0.05212227627635002,-0.06571263819932938,-0.034571051597595215,0.08983252942562103,0.02309076115489006,0.05881635099649429,-0.021370306611061096,0.025191932916641235,0.010207564570009708,-0.020640265196561813,-0.022345272824168205,0.01595783792436123,-0.014672606252133846,0.10001061111688614,-0.007650165818631649,0.0047759320586919785,0.03454931080341339,-0.06752775609493256,0.03367489576339722,-0.009100591763854027,-0.011392157524824142,0.07232555001974106,-0.03488898649811745,-2.3079448535823476e-33,-0.023778563365340233,0.06862325221300125,0.015832236036658287,0.08200020343065262,-0.0004984725383110344,0.05961086228489876,-0.00850305613130331,-0.026414260268211365,-0.012134627439081669,0.018995679914951324,-0.05074864998459816,0.06124272570014,0.052949145436286926,0.054019805043935776,0.12110576033592224,0.01591765694320202,-0.033754512667655945,0.05234053358435631,0.0708460658788681,-0.016328239813447,0.03530297055840492,-0.019825372844934464,-0.06724083423614502,-0.0570317879319191,0.03503671661019325,-0.04083810746669769,-0.04280818626284599,-0.06495589762926102,0.031015649437904358,-0.03473170846700668,-0.018671266734600067,-0.04831967502832413,0.11091525852680206,-0.06546372175216675,0.021192550659179688,-0.015912001952528954,-0.0850541815161705,-0.018276819959282875,-0.008013675920665264,0.02462146431207657,-0.013033374212682247,0.0008448667358607054,-0.02531098760664463,0.07851135730743408,-0.06448650360107422,-0.01784459687769413,0.0001804323255782947,-0.016107110306620598,-0.06686164438724518,-0.06690187007188797,0.0294529777020216,0.03648175299167633,0.03359357267618179,-0.05012043938040733,0.008034564554691315,0.013063658960163593,-0.04399331659078598,0.01349866483360529,-0.007668768987059593,0.018151311203837395,-0.04176149144768715,0.02438203990459442,0.11286650598049164,-0.019108057022094727,0.03980607911944389,0.04806462675333023,-0.11181554943323135,0.01790563203394413,0.0991351529955864,-0.040427036583423615,-0.05035695806145668,0.059206221252679825,0.027666527777910233,-0.00152129668276757,-0.02468026988208294,0.061204444617033005,-0.01919986493885517,0.006513113621622324,0.015676604583859444,0.010452184826135635,-0.03887315094470978,-0.04474961757659912,0.01810874417424202,-0.008661679923534393,0.019151391461491585,0.02004629373550415,0.017230521887540817,0.048895832151174545,-0.010053534992039204,0.08167523890733719,-0.06844212114810944,0.04138922691345215,-0.06729106605052948,0.012974393554031849,0.08458351343870163,-1.2343264655485006e-33,-0.053044192492961884,-0.006916841026395559,-0.06638940423727036,-0.01108131930232048,0.0034226318821310997,0.02081494964659214,-0.08290766179561615,-0.02558867633342743,-0.07216595858335495,-0.035206738859415054,-0.10382280498743057,-0.010735812596976757,0.041238922625780106,0.0012018

{"title":"Optimal project termination with an informed agent","abstract":"This dissertation analyzes optimal incentive contracting for environments in which the state of a temporary project is monitored imperfectly by a firm. The firm must decide when to halt the project, assisted by an agent with private information about the project's state, limited liability, and incentives for delayed project termination. I develop techniques for solving the resulting novel mechanism design problem, which exhibits the feature that the agent extracts information rents despite the absence of time-zero asymmetric information. The firm's problem is to craft dynamic incentives to limit these rents while trading off against reduced efficiency. The optimal contract involves occasional inefficient early project termination, but no late termination; a golden parachute which declines with proximity to termination; and hard and soft deadlines exhibiting asymmetric sensitivity to news close to and far from termination.","vector":[-0.038206443190574646,0.07478541135787964,-0.03592779487371445,-0.013706464320421219,0.02036038041114807,0.03546130657196045,0.07186777144670486,0.023590529337525368,0.09818214923143387,0.1234922856092453,0.030489282682538033,0.06849703937768936,-0.009302693419158459,0.11127287894487381,-0.04689756780862808,0.016176633536815643,0.07820381969213486,0.024471791461110115,-0.002442206721752882,-0.013856783509254456,0.08389238268136978,-0.008389610797166824,0.029542462900280952,0.02680050954222679,0.042501576244831085,-0.059190064668655396,-0.00842652004212141,-0.014008261263370514,0.03012801520526409,-0.08162710815668106,-0.033345695585012436,0.014937524683773518,0.05504036322236061,-0.05181453377008438,0.086065873503685,0.06423651427030563,-0.11120159924030304,-0.007753215730190277,-0.05471247807145119,0.0600966215133667,-0.00599094619974494,0.011179173365235329,-0.02269984781742096,0.050334978848695755,-0.053665097802877426,-0.03744454309344292,0.06714931130409241,0.07543241232633591,-0.058739420026540756,0.019210610538721085,-0.018170589581131935,-0.027727443724870682,-0.0020072932820767164,0.014050669968128204,-0.04390641674399376,0.0057489522732794285,-0.035969078540802,0.006086805835366249,-0.0382416695356369,0.010080371983349323,0.06272014230489731,-0.013710606843233109,-0.07005653530359268,-0.05392013490200043,0.0011521173873916268,0.06182100996375084,0.033251676708459854,0.044870223850011826,-0.1018669381737709,0.029360173270106316,0.015442888252437115,-0.07083041965961456,-0.061128757894039154,-0.07214605808258057,0.029442107304930687,0.029338866472244263,0.041339799761772156,0.06593070924282074,0.028542811051011086,-0.07540754228830338,-0.027222713455557823,-0.1226869449019432,-0.013403207994997501,0.023460328578948975,-0.0891619399189949,-0.06921637058258057,0.07250858843326569,0.029618648812174797,0.17679980397224426,-0.015131883323192596,-0.01159110851585865,-0.021062655374407768,-0.021332157775759697,0.008305736817419529,-0.014536255970597267,0.041173055768013,-0.0007388131343759596,-0.026754308491945267,-0.010559271089732647,0.08334643393754959,-0.031276606023311615,-0.011030162684619427,-0.0770367756485939,-0.0035421312786638737,0.08089885115623474,-0.07115305215120316,-0.03831164166331291,-0.02964959666132927,0.039319947361946106,0.008983682841062546,-0.012092533521354198,0.0032123299315571785,-0.0030487673357129097,-0.06509500741958618,0.07452141493558884,0.07636179774999619,-0.10728298872709274,0.06107455864548683,0.019998645409941673,-0.06839584559202194,0.11272018402814865,0.015351596288383007,-0.020463522523641586,-0.017027651891112328,-0.04580531641840935,0.09264682233333588,-0.020195206627249718,8.877230481654218e-34,0.025014886632561684,0.004573100712150335,-0.002650872338563204,0.017878126353025436,0.03407682105898857,-0.03135337308049202,0.025301698595285416,0.10407549887895584,-0.05389903485774994,0.029051247984170914,-0.005410388577729464,-0.05413173884153366,-0.053705740720033646,-0.0016826543724164367,0.057418834418058395,-0.0909503847360611,0.05384725704789162,0.08592736721038818,0.026265624910593033,-0.012446611188352108,0.023454774171113968,-0.03819582238793373,-0.007769608870148659,-0.04462813213467598,0.0744393914937973,-0.08775597810745239,-0.01718258671462536,-0.03972939774394035,0.013103184290230274,0.013306614011526108,-0.008893195539712906,0.06655864417552948,0.09604302793741226,-0.007486048620194197,-0.05936545878648758,0.014362200163304806,-0.0909971073269844,-0.02398828975856304,0.07317882031202316,0.041889920830726624,0.005690914113074541,-0.02135409601032734,-0.03431980684399605,-0.027918238192796707,0.013636216521263123,-0.10728060454130173,0.0932011604309082,-0.0631398931145668,-0.002182916970923543,-0.037702545523643494,0.06745841354131699,0.04022035375237465,0.04104812070727348,-0.03659789264202118,-0.015847353264689445,-0.04480504244565964,-0.010033651255071163,-0.012531991116702557,-0.05400943011045456,0.02401111088693142,-0.021457450464367867,-0.01148233562707901,0.036267343908548355,-0.0769822895526886,-0.08837942779064178,0.05329422280192375,-0.0630895271897316,0.022512899711728096,0.05311547592282295,-0.036453064531087875,-0.05344098061323166,-0.01063831988722086,0.034570783376693726,-0.11206343024969101,-0.06616751849651337,0.02298315428197384,0.0008778964402154088,0.0031312124338001013,0.08340539038181305,-0.030557820573449135,0.06153741478919983,-0.02900545857846737,0.03900079429149628,-0.028091223910450935,-0.0009354038629680872,0.012502448633313179,0.04786986485123634,0.014434262178838253,-0.027204150334000587,0.03638976812362671,-0.1251021921634674,0.022609427571296692,-0.03539685159921646,0.06179853156208992,0.11116426438093185,-2.840626363471206e-33,-0.007904372178018093,-0.04195311293005943,-0.05102324113249779,-0.0111909294500947,0.046751488000154495,0.02093275636434555,-0.12731817364692688,-0.052352432161569595,-0.04294969141483307,0.05881182476878166,-0.060532096773386,-0.07595627754926682,-0.015545942820608616,0.008701

{"title":"Essays on game theory","abstract":"This dissertation studies various aspects of noncooperative multi-person decision-making. In Chapter 1, I develop a model of Commonly Respectful \"interspection\" in games. This model is applicable to general finite extensive-form games. It covers strategic situations in which upon seeing a suboptimal move by one player, the other players interpret it as a strong signal about the deviator's lower level of strategic sophistication. I propose and study the two corresponding solution concepts: interspected rationalizability and interspected equilibrium. In Chapter 2, I provide a generalized framework for epistemic analysis of complete information games, the interspective framework. I discuss in detail the corresponding process of interspective decision making. I show how by the use of this framework, one may formally express, besides the model of Chapter 1, also the models underlying such solution concepts as normal-form and extensive-form rationalizability, iterative admissibility. Chapter 3 is a joint paper with Nicolas Lambert and Michael Ostrovsky. We study trading behavior and the properties of prices in informationally complex markets. We characterize the equilibrium behavior in the corresponding game-theoretic model. We then use this characterization to study the informational efficiency of prices as the number of strategic traders becomes large.","vector":[-0.0019259399268776178,-0.02516843192279339,0.0008102542487904429,-0.09281852096319199,0.007776093669235706,-0.01178270298987627,0.17412352561950684,0.037271708250045776,0.05907128006219864,0.0570894330739975,-0.020627647638320923,-0.03423130884766579,0.011082174256443977,0.04284685477614403,0.006951899733394384,-0.06195470318198204,0.03336980938911438,-0.02348015271127224,-0.04268805310130119,0.07283174991607666,0.02408430352807045,-0.06966440379619598,-0.0165618434548378,0.00012048825738020241,-0.0041657667607069016,-0.08175034821033478,-0.015289306640625,0.020124288275837898,-0.03887784108519554,-0.02061980776488781,0.012118264101445675,0.035627901554107666,0.04254384711384773,0.03090575523674488,-0.03696979209780693,0.01767001487314701,-0.04125687852501869,-0.020828843116760254,0.015898453071713448,0.04467124864459038,0.010642188601195812,-0.03834167495369911,-0.1015809029340744,-0.03768043965101242,0.005091311875730753,-0.024432778358459473,0.03049480728805065,-0.018215237185359,-0.05816083028912544,-0.010019766166806221,-0.11967084556818008,0.01823357678949833,-0.047606416046619415,-0.0002074472577078268,0.04807749390602112,-0.027992136776447296,-0.030067844316363335,0.004661546088755131,0.023930681869387627,-0.03764916583895683,0.013650668784976006,-0.05346116051077843,-0.05442926287651062,0.045618344098329544,0.028874540701508522,0.03829553350806236,0.042010389268398285,-0.028725313022732735,-0.0486084409058094,0.01035232748836279,0.061598826199769974,-0.009161191992461681,-0.09398788213729858,-0.043405089527368546,0.03799913451075554,-0.07807864248752594,0.00764629989862442,0.02330522984266281,-0.040323205292224884,0.025791455060243607,-0.006145789287984371,-0.00569872185587883,-0.06204710155725479,-0.054981641471385956,0.05905582010746002,-0.10822894424200058,-0.03257551044225693,0.009614424780011177,0.17118163406848907,-0.02346072532236576,-0.12413761019706726,-0.0076093231327831745,-0.0188152976334095,0.022301871329545975,0.09804797172546387,0.06105500087141991,-0.008126139640808105,-0.053711798042058945,0.06717613339424133,0.07631876319646835,0.0018426375463604927,0.027214214205741882,-0.043207112699747086,-0.009616659954190254,0.028029276058077812,-0.004803124349564314,-0.034364890307188034,0.03362097591161728,0.006680716760456562,0.036718934774398804,-0.09412799775600433,-0.05168765038251877,0.00503652635961771,0.04117800295352936,-0.022000335156917572,0.08235814422369003,0.02718411199748516,0.04822520539164543,-0.009339862503111362,-0.03042316623032093,0.04665905609726906,-0.04112272709608078,0.05274125188589096,0.04292883351445198,0.007162808906286955,0.02621183544397354,0.027542416006326675,1.624412704665442e-33,-0.06423091143369675,-0.0490829162299633,0.020841084420681,0.061624448746442795,-0.029542051255702972,0.04122140258550644,-0.030421797186136246,-0.0349133163690567,-0.04905835539102554,0.061566490679979324,0.01625281386077404,0.13970980048179626,-0.009928055107593536,0.04347697272896767,0.08814659714698792,0.028746560215950012,-0.04219194874167442,0.041931718587875366,0.0707487240433693,-0.05664263293147087,0.12778443098068237,0.03898536413908005,-0.04832415282726288,-0.0421677902340889,0.020407481119036674,-0.011102997697889805,-0.0410301499068737,-0.02017415314912796,0.0805005431175232,-0.013716071844100952,-0.0020814230665564537,-0.02524694986641407,-0.023686682805418968,0.011872299015522003,0.004844239912927151,0.06262508779764175,-0.12338506430387497,-0.007984309457242489,0.012464004568755627,0.016618112102150917,-0.02153625525534153,-0.00212623318657279,-0.02767258882522583,0.04471791163086891,-0.03949109464883804,-0.03126678988337517,-0.05371600389480591,-0.0025871810503304005,-0.09252733737230301,-0.051762741059064865,-0.01523457933217287,0.025248706340789795,0.03263940289616585,-0.09281030297279358,-0.06623660027980804,0.009369966574013233,-0.058598294854164124,-0.013284063898026943,-0.05140591785311699,0.021161971613764763,-0.06486824154853821,-0.012761526741087437,0.021980974823236465,-0.011522437445819378,-0.07017440348863602,0.08107300847768784,-0.11857815831899643,0.012397169135510921,0.09300050884485245,-0.08668486028909683,-0.02886226586997509,0.056200962513685226,0.04110101982951164,-0.009029878303408623,0.02376498281955719,-0.03652463108301163,-0.03270970657467842,0.007371277082711458,0.011102833785116673,0.03480276092886925,-0.04076346755027771,-0.0013433948624879122,-0.013253867626190186,0.006285327021032572,0.001036786357872188,0.0007210270850919187,-0.010805600322782993,-0.018922531977295876,0.012222593650221825,0.03605809435248375,-0.06540442258119583,0.0881943628191948,-0.03559667244553566,-0.018976526334881783,0.08740647882223129,-5.453815508551423e-33,-0.004784638062119484,-0.11749860644340515,-0.08690015226602554,0.041076820343732834,0.030791087076067924,-0.01167113333940506,-0.10223818570375443,-0.019385259598493576,0.03657524660229683,-0.05455427244305611,-0.11411745101213455,0.04381762817502022,0.11275137960910797,-0.0245670136064291,

{"title":"Essays on economic networks","abstract":"This dissertation theoretically analyzes how networks of relationships among decision-makers affect two kinds of economic processes: (i) investment in public goods; and (ii) repeated updating of beliefs or behaviors based on observing neighbors. The results connect these processes to the spectral properties of networks -- that is, eigenvalues and eigenvectors -- and use the connection to shed light on economic outcomes. The first essay, based on joint work with Matthew Elliott, focuses on games in which each player simultaneously exerts costly effort that provides different benefits to each other player. The goal is to find and describe effort profiles that are immune to coordinated coalitional deviations when such a game is played repeatedly. Formally, these effort profiles are the ones that can be sustained in a strong Nash equilibrium of the repeated game. We introduce a class of effort profiles that are called centrality-stable. These are characterized by a network centrality condition: agent A's contribution (defined as effort level times marginal cost) is equal to a weighted sum of the contributions of those who help A; the weight on B's contribution measures the marginal benefit B's effort provides to A. Under certain assumptions (mainly concavity of utility functions), centrality-stable profiles exist, are Pareto-efficient, and any such profile is sustainable in a coalitionally robust equilibrium of the repeated game. Centrality-stable profiles also have an alternative definition: they are those at which all agents are first-order indifferent to scaling all efforts by a factor

{"title":"Essays in microeconomics","abstract":"This dissertation consists of three essays in the field of microeconomics. In Chapter 1, I consider dynamic optimal pricing of platform membership (a durable good) and usage (a non-durable good) under network effects. Users with different outside options make platform membership decisions irregularly. Once becoming a member, a user makes platform usage decisions regularly. Examples of such a platform include a video game console and a computer operating system. I show that, in a Markov perfect equilibrium, the platform's market power is weakened by the network effect and the potential damage to future sale. If the network effect is sufficiently weak, a small platform expects slow growth and surplus extraction thus decreases with the platform size. On the other hand, if the network effect is sufficiently strong, a platform foresees a large expected market share in the long run and surplus extraction thus increases with the platform size. The intensity of the network effect and the ability to commit to a future price path decrease the risk of failure to launch and increase the mean and all higher moments of the long-run market share. Chapter 2 is a joint work with Nur Sunar. Motivated by pricing, advertising, and product diffusion of collaborative information technology services, we consider a monopolist firm that sells a non-divisible product in a connected customer network over a discrete time horizon. The seller chooses, optimally, a target agent to be awarded with promotion and sets prices for each potential customer in the network. Each agent makes purchasing decisions based on the intrinsic valuation of the product and the local network benefit, which is increasing in the number of neighbors who own the product. We demonstrate that, under the uniform pricing strategy, the seller, optimally, offers promotion to the agent with highest decay centrality with a decay parameter equal to the discount factor, and the optimal price increases with the discount factor. We also extend our analysis to a combinatorial setting in which the seller can promote the product to multiple agents in the customer network. We prove that the optimal target group size decreases with the discount factor. Moreover, contrary to the single-target selection problem, the optimal uniform price decreases with the seller's discount factor for a sufficiently high discount factor. Although the seller has complete information about the intrinsic valuation and the local network benefit, under the optimal pricing and advertising strategies, the seller may not capture the entire customer base. In Chapter 3, I study how delay in negotiations arises by analyzing a dynamic model of stochastic bilateral bargaining with proposer's advantage. The proposer in the current period has an advantage of becoming the proposer in the next period. I show that under asymmetric information about the endowment, there exists a semi-pooling Markov perfect equilibrium, under the good-faith rule and a low initial belief of the uninformed player that the informed player has a high endowment signal. In the equilibrium, the uninformed player screens among types of the informed player until the agreement is reached, and the better informed player obtains the information rent. The delay in agreement occurs from uncertainty about the identity of the proposer and the screening process of the uninformed player. If an institution can optimally set the proposer's mover advantage to minimize the expected delay in agreement at the beginning of the negotiation, the optimal proposer's advantage increases with the initial probability that the informed player proposes first and with the discount factor.

{"title":"Essays in microeconomic theory","abstract":"This dissertation consists of two chapters in two different areas of microeconomic theory: the informativeness of prices and optimal taxation. In both of these chapters, I develop a model that lends itself to game-theoretic analysis. Chapter 1 is a theoretical study on the informativeness of prices in financial markets. I study a class of mechanisms that represent a financial market for a security. These mechanisms quote a price, which solely depends on the total number of shares outstanding. Traders can sequentially buy or sell shares of the security, and get to trade many times. Among the class of such mechanisms, I determine which ones lead to immediate revelation of information by the traders, in the sense that traders immediately bring the price to their posterior belief about the value of the security in the first period where they are given an opportunity to trade. I find that while it is possible to find mechanisms that achieve this property for all information structures with conditionally independent signals, it is impossible to find a mechanism that achieves it for every information structure. Chapter 2 develops a model of optimal redistributive taxation for social insurance purposes when agents are able to share risks with a group of relatives and friends, achieving a Pareto optimal allocation within the group. It describes how the sizes of these groups (syndicates) affect the optimal tax rate. When syndicates are exogenously given, the optimal linear tax decreases as the sizes of syndicates increase. A model of joint syndicate formation and optimal policy choice is then proposed. Syndicates are formed by agents for risk-sharing purposes, at a cost which decreases with geographical, social and blood proximity between agents. In setting the income tax rate, the government takes into account the impact of its policy on the efforts made by agents to form syndicates. This may considerably alter the government's problem, to the extent that it may become locally convex and, as proximity decreases (e.g. because related agents are more geographically mobile), the government's optimal policy may jump from a zero tax rate to a substantial positive rate. This could partially explain why social insurance schemes emerged late in the development of countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United

{"title":"Contributions to microeconomic theory","abstract":"This dissertation consists of contributions to three different \"waves\" or \"eras\" of microeconomic theory from around 1950 until today. All three contributions concern environments featuring uncertainty. In the first of these three eras, the focus was largely on choice theory, both individual and social, and on equilibrium in perfectly competitive markets. My first chapter contributes to the theory of individual choice. I provide axiomatic foundations for supermodularity and quasisupermodularity of Bernoulli utility functions in the context of choice over lotteries. In the second of the eras, the focus shifted to game theory and to its application to information economics and mechanism design. In Chapter 2, I provide a contribution to this literature: I analyze the problem of designing dynamic mechanisms for agents who learn about a common component of their valuation through experience, and privately: Whoever gets a unit today acquires a private signal about the common value, aside from enjoying immediate surplus. Thus, allocating a unit today creates an informational asymmetry tomorrow. This problem resembles economic environments where parties interacting over time privately gather socially valuable information, and when this information acquisition is a result of the outcome of their interaction, rather than being exogenously given. Recently, microeconomic theorists have begun to turn their attention towards behavioral economics, and towards problems where are boundedly rational is some fashion, and hence they are unable to find the \"optimal\" course of action in the complex environment that they inhabit. Chapter 3 concerns the second type of behavioral problem. A decision maker faces a finite set of alternatives and every period chooses a subset from this set. The values of the alternatives are drawn from an unknown distribution, and the decision maker only observes the realized values of those alternatives in the chosen subset. Due to the information structure of this problem, we are unable to fully characterize optimal strategies. Instead, I propose and analyze heuristics.","vector":[-0.029386840760707855,-0.0037372063379734755,-0.038901809602975845,-0.04741955175995827,0.05196117237210274,-0.002744989702478051,0.09883327782154083,0.09829883277416229,0.03747064992785454,0.020730875432491302,-0.006815433502197266,0.016874833032488823,0.05850325897336006,0.009796789847314358,0.004644664470106363,-0.04416463524103165,0.07922579348087311,0.032051101326942444,-0.07092335820198059,0.05242461338639259,0.09002450108528137,-0.08997724950313568,-0.020248854532837868,-0.03958115354180336,-0.024170443415641785,-0.03459241986274719,-0.010233950801193714,0.012894694693386555,-0.015791140496730804,-0.0779954120516777,-0.03256034106016159,0.07194744795560837,0.09554770588874817,-0.06526050716638565,0.0318559855222702,0.04599718749523163,-0.02380331978201866,-0.009553060866892338,-0.030498038977384567,0.027435768395662308,0.00035584738361649215,-0.041794292628765106,-0.06550892442464828,-0.00042720482451841235,-0.0563068613409996,0.02476576343178749,0.0796230360865593,0.031600434333086014,-0.050406333059072495,0.008508005179464817,-0.06527864933013916,0.01693779230117798,0.004796972032636404,-0.044459667056798935,0.03729228302836418,0.058986250311136246,-0.0227295383810997,-0.03826064243912697,-0.04266117140650749,-0.06678300350904465,-0.03056516870856285,-0.06498213112354279,-0.03248528018593788,-0.00425708806142211,0.07505372911691666,0.059474632143974304,0.010795101523399353,0.020929398015141487,-0.021056851372122765,0.029506590217351913,0.057643234729766846,-0.03177609294652939,-0.08700544387102127,-0.013968408107757568,0.07202664017677307,-0.09497891366481781,0.011690584942698479,-0.008115327917039394,-0.011106589809060097,0.034382451325654984,-0.038782715797424316,-0.06730330735445023,-0.06290435045957565,-0.031265903264284134,0.007923481985926628,-0.059496913105249405,-0.0053526051342487335,-0.03140656277537346,0.14813132584095,-0.03586948662996292,-0.0744691789150238,-0.028194494545459747,-0.026399703696370125,0.04955093562602997,0.14184491336345673,0.03066367655992508,-0.031048201024532318,-0.03137136995792389,0.07455584406852722,0.11657071113586426,-0.016873981803655624,-0.000925480795558542,0.006595874670892954,0.061361413449048996,0.06810808181762695,-0.081839419901371,-0.05911124125123024,0.053222183138132095,0.07694055885076523,0.046518631279468536,-0.033776119351387024,-0.06046484783291817,0.048466429114341736,0.033503931015729904,-0.0035142404958605766,-0.028374923393130302,0.04783394932746887,0.032778654247522354,-0.05464709550142288,-0.03358232602477074,0.10235720127820969,-0.025164814665913582,-0.028289932757616043,-0.017111657187342644,-0.014485437422990799,0.0741603896021843,-0.0191310066729784,3.3967698222475155e-33,-0.04393460229039192,-0.03244738280773163,0.04682875797152519,-0.008192111738026142,-0.005408124066889286,0.0027624848298728466,-0.00806218758225441,-0.015172501094639301,-0.047009676694869995,0.0053734444081783295,0.024404900148510933,0.09467300027608871,-0.0194323118776083,0.08931169658899307,0.08076626807451248,-0.08136697113513947,-0.055927909910678864,0.008677436038851738,0.1506357192993164,-0.03382110223174095,0.07733501493930817,0.032056212425231934,-0.031222142279148102,-0.09455897659063339,-0.022315213456749916,-0.03510361164808273,-0.01752014085650444,-0.015098822303116322,0.06207697093486786,-0.007745217531919479,-0.016483059152960777,-0.006675493437796831,-0.006011206656694412,-0.019663287326693535,-0.004477435257285833,0.020861240103840828,-0.08559266477823257,-0.039294999092817307,-0.04222957789897919,-0.03191545233130455,0.001633116859011352,-0.0008820536313578486,-0.04643726348876953,0.018656665459275246,-0.06569810211658478,-0.015240716747939587,0.05582196265459061,0.042504698038101196,-0.0659894272685051,-0.07224128395318985,0.007377185858786106,-0.0037520851474255323,-0.014055751264095306,-0.07357207685709,-0.06090368703007698,-0.024704428389668465,-0.08033719658851624,-0.038677800446748734,-0.0645262822508812,-0.014171489514410496,-0.002950672060251236,-0.004642748273909092,0.1470210701227188,0.029821474105119705,-0.02329796552658081,0.08989450335502625,-0.08543465286493301,-0.027589358389377594,0.08781300485134125,-0.09210991114377975,0.02172287367284298,0.08041216433048248,-0.001249606371857226,-0.0415293388068676,0.0035035365726798773,0.029196837916970253,0.030489366501569748,0.019318414852023125,0.021929634734988213,-0.031222879886627197,0.013455290347337723,-0.05347903445363045,0.011342231184244156,-0.00990988314151764,-0.035714585334062576,0.0639161542057991,0.04836360737681389,-0.03457089141011238,-0.014029079116880894,-0.00408273795619607,-0.04225753992795944,-0.011138212867081165,-0.046556420624256134,0.02439720183610916,0.0138810183852911,-6.793507318400383e-33,-0.03468042239546776,-0.07403639703989029,-0.0022106366232037544,0.017671460285782814,0.04462471604347229,0.022243617102503777,-0.07763276249170303,-0.0744142159819603,-0.048181820660829544,-0.020280957221984863,-0.13433031737804413,0.06951167434453964,0.086299

{"title":"Contracting over actions","abstract":"I consider models in which contracts are written over the verifiable actions taken by an agent in multiple decisions. The principal's preferences over actions depend on underlying states of the world, but only the agent observes the states. The principal cannot audit the agent's information or punish her ex post for having taken inappropriate actions. Moreover, the principal is uncertain about the agent's preferences conditional on the states. Chapter 2 extends the concept of a quota contract to account for discounting and for the possibility of infinitely many periods: a discounted quota fixes the number of expected discounted plays on each action. Discounted quotas are optimal contract forms, even if arbitrary dynamic transfer payments are available, if the agent is assumed to have state-independent preferences. I recursively characterize the optimal discounted quotas for an infinitely repeated problem with independent and identically distributed states. Then I give a more explicit description of these contracts in the limit as interactions become frequent, and when only two actions are available. In Chapter 3 I allow the agent's preferences to depend on the states of the world. Under a variety of assumptions on the timing of the game and on the set of possible agent utility functions, I solve for the max-min optimal mechanisms -- those which maximize the principal's payoff against the worst possible agent preference type. These mechanisms are characterized by a property which I call \"aligned delegation.\" Max-min optimal mechanisms may take the simple forms of simultaneous ranking mechanisms, sequential quotas, or budgets.","vector":[-0.11709284037351608,0.008420318365097046,-0.004063267260789871,-0.05523613467812538,-0.010290170088410378,0.09673318266868591,0.04612062871456146,0.03507881984114647,0.10040335357189178,0.12454065680503845,-0.02593502402305603,0.02112238109111786,0.04359803721308708,0.07585007697343826,-0.018908370286226273,-0.017773227766156197,0.09087154269218445,-0.013325953856110573,-0.08734066039323807,0.02378229796886444,0.052589673548936844,-0.0519297830760479,-0.004871278535574675,-0.0014552546199411154,-0.041859954595565796,-0.0236112792044878,0.02810312621295452,-0.02979055978357792,-0.027143118903040886,-0.015058460645377636,-0.00523547874763608,-0.06366388499736786,0.06318031996488571,-0.03461432084441185,0.043334610760211945,0.04677531495690346,-0.041785940527915955,-0.08049914985895157,-0.03213884308934212,-0.016547733917832375,-0.0011102104326710105,0.011583295650780201,-0.020354799926280975,0.028531266376376152,0.009803562425076962,-0.05472000688314438,0.03988415375351906,0.006926971022039652,-0.05599350109696388,-0.022176140919327736,0.06331251561641693,-0.006386473774909973,0.06916961073875427,-0.02278355322778225,0.001274351729080081,-0.06359092146158218,-0.01511194184422493,0.03242870047688484,-0.011772839352488518,-0.009594808332622051,-0.04931528866291046,-0.08069479465484619,-0.051607925444841385,0.0225059911608696,-0.0030145500786602497,0.04359487444162369,-0.03788862004876137,0.03656765818595886,-0.11359492689371109,0.0964164286851883,-0.04278906062245369,0.04104264825582504,-0.08095535635948181,-0.0656372606754303,0.04280329868197441,-0.04683976247906685,0.030901391059160233,-0.0006586555973626673,-0.020753445103764534,-0.04399733990430832,-0.033781010657548904,-0.04594604671001434,0.029236625880002975,-0.015352453105151653,-0.015054735355079174,-0.10344737023115158,-0.05354538559913635,-0.035174716264009476,0.14795340597629547,-0.05888504162430763,-0.022588666528463364,0.033163197338581085,0.0326465480029583,0.005124568939208984,0.0492607057094574,0.09288778156042099,-0.020334428176283836,-0.004371103830635548,0.025459764525294304,0.06843037158250809,0.022444982081651688,-0.048812031745910645,-0.05847986787557602,-0.02214808203279972,0.03556829318404198,-0.026083584874868393,-0.09224271774291992,-0.05356595665216446,-0.017392782494425774,0.01172969862818718,-0.025044739246368408,-0.03810529038310051,0.04458184167742729,0.036635253578424454,-0.006818132475018501,0.013046111911535263,0.003987560514360666,0.017749706283211708,0.00481468765065074,-0.007965890690684319,0.03851364180445671,-0.03768046945333481,0.07670019567012787,-0.009050492197275162,-0.010165221057832241,0.06680268049240112,0.04396233707666397,4.5130725223761314e-33,0.007148220669478178,-0.0758473202586174,0.015802986919879913,-0.12359116226434708,0.004301573149859905,0.04532228037714958,0.0367400087416172,0.05439670756459236,-0.04084600880742073,0.0022480173502117395,0.05106616020202637,0.01925334334373474,-0.02834942564368248,0.05364833027124405,0.054279014468193054,-0.007602193392813206,0.011705450713634491,0.0976247638463974,0.13410067558288574,-0.009482024237513542,0.047975435853004456,0.01938595250248909,0.05527474731206894,-0.06010905280709267,0.002883941400796175,-0.06216414272785187,-0.0045325132086873055,-0.022285763174295425,0.02834683284163475,0.012632444500923157,0.0010123982792720199,0.06214987114071846,-0.010402644984424114,0.02807154506444931,-0.022061776369810104,0.0840374082326889,-0.0650901347398758,0.04466531053185463,0.0002475452783983201,-0.04162292182445526,-0.041076306253671646,-0.0006010968354530632,0.045376189053058624,0.018237007781863213,-0.04918251931667328,-0.032170817255973816,0.04863395169377327,-0.027808913961052895,-0.07473087310791016,0.0018622209317982197,7.1494207077194e-05,0.02894100546836853,-0.008623439818620682,-0.07258624583482742,0.001659561414271593,-0.060637474060058594,-0.05012528598308563,0.07083678990602493,-0.002241243841126561,0.021258670836687088,0.03467365354299545,-0.08592519164085388,0.03457041457295418,-0.004430389031767845,-0.014982226304709911,0.07425844669342041,-0.07360946387052536,0.0008719874313101172,0.06733495742082596,-0.023016110062599182,-0.003918077331036329,0.07828738540410995,0.014345140196383,-0.07743504643440247,0.016171200200915337,-0.04573432356119156,0.1313653290271759,0.042783088982105255,-0.03491636738181114,-0.005619737319648266,-0.05967835709452629,-0.07176575809717178,-0.016236625611782074,0.039393577724695206,-0.05097586289048195,-0.07485070824623108,-0.0332140251994133,-0.04770698770880699,0.005497983656823635,-0.04889354109764099,-0.013696643523871899,-0.01775766722857952,0.01551251020282507,0.06995933502912521,0.09422065317630768,-5.836849608082896e-33,0.06978777050971985,-0.0049630431458354,0.054924167692661285,0.03901700675487518,0.019339876249432564,-0.03266339749097824,-0.1370198130607605,-0.006710126996040344,0.005925172474235296,-0.04953637346625328,-0.11535602807998657,0.020434483885765076,0.07569365203380585,0.02182193286716

{"title":"Structure and function in neural networks","abstract":"Biology is unique among the natural sciences for its study of systems which exist, in some sense, to solve problems. Neuroscience, in turn, is unique within biology for the kinds of complex, multi-step, and high-dimensional information processing problems it confronts: visual object recognition, spatial reasoning and navigation, linguistic communication, and social behavior, to name a few. On its face, neuroscience is about discovering the brain's solutions to these problems. In many cases, however, this is likely to be extremely difficult without first understanding the tasks themselves, at least well enough that we could recognize the brain's solution if we saw it. In this dissertation, I present results from three sets of projects exemplifying a task-based approach to neuroscience. In one set of projects, we study recurrent neural networks trained to solve a navigation task, which were recently shown to spontaneously develop periodic firing patterns like those of entorhinal grid cells. Through detailed virtual neurophysiology and connectomics, we discover the network mechanisms responsible for grid firing in the network. Further, an analytic study of the objective function used during training reveals that hexagonal grids are indeed optimal for the task, furnishing a normative explanation for grid firing in both artificial and biological neural networks. The second set of projects is motivated by the idea that the functions implemented by biological circuits -- e.g. visual object recognition -- are, in some sense, aligned to the statistical structure of the input data, rather than random. We study a very simple form of alignment between input data and task, deriving exact formulas for the generalization error of both a linear model and the random feature model as a function of alignment. We prove that aligned tasks are indeed easier to learn. In the process, we uncover a rich mathematical structure relating to the spectrum of kernel matrices, predict, and then confirm, a novel empirical phenomenon known as multiple sample-wise descent, and demonstrate the application of recently developed mathematical techniques from the field of free probability to problems in learning theory. The third and final set of projects concerns the important practical issue of when one can accurately detect and decode low-dimensional task structure in neural recordings. Using a combination of techniques from statistical physics, random matrix theory, and free probability, we derive formulas for the detectability/decodability of low-dimensional signals in noisy data and demonstrate the predictions of the theory in the newly coined \\emph{extensive spike model}.

{"title":"Essays in economic growth","abstract":"This thesis contains three chapters, each investigating a question related to economic growth. The first chapter, co-authored with Mohamad Adhami and Emma Rockall, studies the consequences of product market power for economic growth through the lens of a general equilibrium model firm-driven endogenous technological change. In this framework, differentiated firms engage in monopolistic competition, charge heterogeneous markups, and make forward-looking investments in R&D to improve their process efficiency. Markups distort the scale at which these firms operate and, therefore, affect their incentives to invest in R&D. With dispersion in markups, both the aggregate and cross-firm allocations of such investments are distorted. Using firm-level administrative data from France to discipline our model, we find that correcting the product market distortions induced by markups increases the long-run growth rate of productivity by 1.2 percentage points per year. Nearly 75% of this faster productivity growth can be achieved by simply reallocating R&D resources across firms, revealing that the dispersion in markups, rather than their average level, is more detrimental to economic growth.  The second chapter studies the (mis)allocation of research talent in the U.S., and its consequences for economic growth. In 1976, 4% of inventors in the U.S. were women, and by 2020, that fraction had only moved up to 12%. Under the natural assumption that there are no intrinsic differences in inventive potential across genders, the scarcity of women in research reveals that the U.S. is missing out on some of its brightest minds. This raises two questions: (1) What are the barriers faced by those ``lost'' Jennifer Doudnas? and (2) How costly is this (mis)allocation of talent for aggregate productivity and welfare? I tackle these questions through the lens of a semi-endogenous growth model in which individuals with heterogeneous talent choose between a career in research or production. However, gendered barriers can deter or prevent women from pursuing their comparative advantage. Interpreting micro-level data on the universe of U.S. inventors through this framework, I find that women and men inventors are just too similarly productive and educated for distortions operating through selection or human capital to play a prominent role. The evidence instead suggests that the underlying barriers are more likely related to a lack of opportunities and relevant role models for women in research. Taking advantage of the structure of this theory, I find that lifting all barriers to female innovation would be equivalent to permanently raising everyone's consumption by 2.7%.  The third chapter, co-authored with Pete Klenow and Chad Jones, studies the evolution of racial disparities in economic well-being over time in the United States. We construct a measure of consumption-equivalent welfare for Black and White Americans. Our statistic incorporates life expectancy, consumption, leisure, and inequality. Welfare for Black Americans was 43% of that for White Americans in 1984 and rose to 59% by 2019. Going back further in time (albeit with more limited data), the gap was even larger, with Black welfare equal to just 29% of White welfare in 1940. On the one hand, there has been remarkable progress for Black Americans: the level of their consumption-equivalent welfare increased by a factor of 26 between 1940 and 2019, when aggregate consumption per person rose a more modest 5-fold. On the other hand, despite this remarkable progress, the welfare gap in 2019 remains disconcertingly large. The gap appears even larger when we make rough attempts to incorporate omitted factors such as morbidity, incarceration, and unemployment.","vector":[-0.02427908405661583,-0.09028223156929016,0.012113652192056179,-0.006692199502140284,0.031548552215099335,0.03813055902719498,-0.031229007989168167,0.08307500928640366,0.041306186467409134,0.010938593186438084,-0.054989490658044815,0.09886837005615234,0.024760035797953606,-0.008133986033499241,-0.006436482071876526,-0.016030795872211456,0.04402213916182518,0.004914280492812395,-0.05374837666749954,-0.047368790954351425,0.08584959805011749,-0.09240078926086426,0.0691840723156929,-0.0026544914580881596,0.0814364030957222,-0.05255347862839699,-0.020152531564235687,-0.03776174783706665,-0.014018666930496693,-0.01613764464855194,-0.0014616937842220068,0.02809404954314232,0.006943384651094675,-0.039616480469703674,0.055758070200681686,0.01863832212984562,0.031534384936094284,0.03805765137076378,0.03314589336514473,0.06137595698237419,0.03612609580159187,-0.023213613778352737,-0.05904131755232811,-0.003196700941771269,0.035270772874355316,-0.0460045151412487,0.03323131799697876,0.1265316605567932,-0.029838230460882187,-0.05187753587961197,-0.03453395515680313,-0.019731935113668442,-0.03938192501664162,-0.0054100570268929005,-0.023676687851548195,0.02041957713663578,-0.025547102093696594,0.009068791754543781,0.036143600940704346,0.02269989252090454,-0.0209195613861084,-0.041832659393548965,0.06900367140769958,-0.033043716102838516,0.027585400268435478,-0.06718755513429642,-0.042670100927352905,0.08713769912719727,-0.12328584492206573,0.07372211664915085,-0.03784135356545448,0.008704538457095623,-0.08223961293697357,-0.13423223793506622,0.02608720026910305,0.02020847797393799,-0.029350636526942253,0.09980466961860657,0.10786683857440948,-0.06977303326129913,0.03567281365394592,-0.06657727807760239,-0.08544516563415527,-0.005275757517665625,-0.07879150658845901,-0.00955544225871563,0.09006692469120026,-0.06598470360040665,0.09553420543670654,-0.012604991905391216,0.019426703453063965,0.005852349568158388,-0.07309813052415848,0.005049487575888634,-0.028165915980935097,-0.0016651017358526587,-0.010827296413481236,-0.021918389946222305,0.010343344882130623,0.05566798523068428,0.04749415069818497,-0.02091020531952381,0.05688082054257393,0.03173665329813957,-0.06569697707891464,-0.06685276329517365,-0.04134783148765564,0.03712531924247742,0.05467917025089264,-0.01802070438861847,0.04396411031484604,0.04757056012749672,-0.06752175092697144,0.07940924912691116,-0.03468293324112892,-0.03311752527952194,-0.01741369627416134,-0.032916199415922165,0.0409575030207634,0.0010016626911237836,0.01036051008850336,0.035803984850645065,-0.0506516769528389,0.01758785918354988,-0.04418248310685158,0.02406681329011917,-0.0668402761220932,3.0364449878769828e-33,0.06511428952217102,0.06263390183448792,-0.0055005778558552265,0.025334374979138374,-0.07686101645231247,0.02936186082661152,-0.04472128301858902,0.05416272580623627,-0.07569659501314163,0.004913811106234789,-0.07212170213460922,0.03932899236679077,0.006407610140740871,0.060517389327287674,0.12036282569169998,0.026548244059085846,0.0058015333488583565,0.07790777087211609,0.027268514037132263,-0.053644731640815735,0.00651053711771965,-0.008560243993997574,0.018362421542406082,0.021937895566225052,0.004734375048428774,0.009950411505997181,-0.09484320878982544,-0.04324229061603546,-0.003891665954142809,0.006129251327365637,0.027801377698779106,0.029873725026845932,0.02183004654943943,0.022139064967632294,-0.09882314503192902,0.015248495154082775,-0.03096136823296547,-0.04196477681398392,0.08887476474046707,0.02665822207927704,0.0075192442163825035,0.005376990884542465,-0.03796795755624771,0.05835801362991333,-0.07683267444372177,0.01955290324985981,0.06756133586168289,-0.01744098961353302,-0.0037189738359302282,0.01140667125582695,-0.0066977269016206264,0.07365846633911133,0.035388678312301636,-0.13468338549137115,0.02366291545331478,0.04972388967871666,-0.047349847853183746,-0.009218155406415462,0.09671135246753693,0.021042361855506897,-0.11471650749444962,0.03394796699285507,0.026813741773366928,0.07798711955547333,-0.10979024320840836,0.10691767185926437,0.07683684676885605,0.011847847141325474,0.04923027753829956,0.05397336930036545,-0.04065430164337158,-0.051648445427417755,-0.009207463823258877,0.0362490750849247,0.02697845734655857,-0.027219992130994797,-0.00032401634962297976,0.008292566984891891,0.03880048915743828,-0.0031450348906219006,-0.07634679973125458,0.0588405504822731,-0.04572932422161102,-0.11887974292039871,0.014590779319405556,-0.11020790785551071,0.013110028579831123,-0.05990597605705261,0.09415867924690247,0.003763349261134863,-0.010240485891699791,-0.027177968993782997,-0.05953541398048401,0.0336642824113369,0.021765822544693947,-5.380330581235722e-33,0.005213097203522921,0.0024103857576847076,-0.04019167646765709,0.02447514794766903,-0.012979409657418728,-0.010495944879949093,0.00267453002743423,0.010790174826979637,-0.014193842187523842,-0.06794698536396027,-0.04865291342139244,-0.02592475898563862,0.002359330188483,0.05588105320930481

{"title":"Low-risk cesarean birth : racial/ethnic disparities, multilevel factors, and the potential to reduce downstream severe maternal morbidity","abstract":"Cesarean birth is the most common surgical procedure in the United States and is a life-saving intervention when medically indicated. Cesarean birth is also associated with perinatal risks such as infection and post-partum depression and increases the risk of cesarean delivery in subsequent births. Among low-risk births, typically defined as nulliparous, term, singleton, and vertex (NTSV), the overuse of cesarean birth can be an indicator of poor quality of care. It is particularly concerning that there are disparities in the prevalence of low-risk cesarean birth, with racially and socioeconomically marginalized populations experiencing the highest risk of NTSV cesarean birth. To this end, we explore two key objectives using population-based data from California: (1) assess the contributions of multi-level factors, in particular the role of hospital and ZIP code level socioeconomic disadvantage, to racial/ethnic disparities in low-risk cesarean rate, where race/ethnicity is considered a social factor and a proxy for structural racism, and (2) assess the downstream impact of low-risk cesarean birth (as a potentially modifiable risk factor) on severe maternal morbidity (SMM) in the next pregnancy.  In Chapter 2, we examine the contribution of birth hospital to racial/ethnic disparities in low-risk cesarean births, under the premise that a lower risk-adjusted hospital-level cesarean birth rate is an indicator of better quality of care. We use G-computation substitution to estimate how racial/ethnic variability in low-risk cesarean changes if racially minoritized populations (contrary to what is observed) give birth at the same distribution of hospitals as White individuals. In Chapter 3, we investigate the combined effect of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic disadvantage on low-risk cesarean birth via an interaction analysis, first by identifying groups most at risk of cesarean birth based on race/ethnicity and socioeconomic disadvantage and second by assessing how racial/ethnic disparities in low-risk cesarean birth vary across levels of socioeconomic disadvantage. In Chapter 4 we investigate how low-risk cesarean birth among primiparous individuals impacts their risk of SMM in the next pregnancy. We conduct a counterfactual impact analysis to quantify the decrease in subsequent SMM that could occur if there were a decrease in low-risk cesarean first birth. These chapters provide evidence of the contribution of multi-level factors such as birth hospital and socioeconomic disadvantage to racial/ethnic disparities in low-risk cesarean birth as well as

{"title":"Fusing multimodal knowledge in language models","abstract":"Language models, such as GPT-4, have the capability to generate textual responses to user queries. They are used across various tasks, including question answering, translation, summarization, and personal assistance. However, to create more versatile AI assistants, these models need to handle more diverse and complex tasks involving domain or visual knowledge, such as answering medical questions and explaining or generating images. This necessity motivates the development of models that can access and leverage diverse knowledge sources beyond text, such as databases and images.  In this thesis, we aim to develop language models capable of using multimodal knowledge, encompassing text, knowledge graphs, and images, to address various user queries. Text provides broad and contextually rich knowledge, knowledge graphs often supply structured domain knowledge, and images facilitate various visual applications.  This thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter introduces methods for language models to efficiently learn knowledge from textual data. Specifically, we train language models on a sequence of multiple related documents, encouraging them to learn and reason about knowledge with long-range dependencies. This approach yields strong performance on complex long-context and multi-step reasoning tasks. In the second chapter, we introduce methods that enable language models to harness knowledge graph information. Specifically, we develop a new model architecture, a hybrid of language models and graph neural networks, along with a training objective that fuses text and knowledge graph representations. This method demonstrates strong performance on tasks involving domain knowledge, such as medical question answering. In the third chapter, to empower language models to use and generate visual content alongside textual information, we design unified multimodal models capable of encoding, retrieving, and decoding interleaved sequences of text and images. The model employs a retriever to fetch textual or visual knowledge and integrates it into a multimodal Transformer that encodes and decodes both text and images using token representations. Finally, in the forth and fifth chapters, we demonstrate the application of textual, structured, and visual knowledge fusion techniques to solve practical healthcare tasks, including clinical trial outcome prediction and multimodal medical question answering.  In summary, this thesis builds models capable of comprehending and generating multimodal content, spanning text, knowledge graphs, and images.","vector":[-0.027989480644464493,-0.03976864367723465,-0.018083903938531876,0.06176338344812393,0.02550096996128559,-0.0038479131180793047,0.027301041409373283,0.06374551355838776,0.0027530582156032324,-0.039648883044719696,-0.024201765656471252,-0.04209815710783005,0.10344837605953217,0.11187073588371277,0.018730491399765015,0.05361861363053322,0.018799887970089912,0.04698597639799118,-0.10556567460298538,-0.047484103590250015,0.018697137013077736,0.013299274258315563,0.0791844055056572,-0.01627681776881218,0.021779818460345268,0.025731094181537628,0.023991314694285393,-0.09217038005590439,0.04054827243089676,-0.020949561148881912,0.048836007714271545,-0.026752930134534836,-0.022721508517861366,0.10335838049650192,-0.0587693527340889,0.10982746630907059,-0.040751807391643524,0.06993716210126877,-0.01355687901377678,-0.042049430310726166,-0.01017600204795599,-0.023688312619924545,0.015839163213968277,0.04549838602542877,0.1463669240474701,0.05023838207125664,-0.08952807635068893,-0.012985149398446083,0.10284207761287689,0.04865823686122894,-0.1601743996143341,-0.04544614627957344,-0.046022821217775345,0.019844383001327515,0.06136476248502731,0.034973710775375366,-0.014771289192140102,-0.044044379144907,-0.008371604606509209,-0.029325244948267937,0.02067471295595169,-0.07916409522294998,-0.028841214254498482,-0.01675376109778881,-0.032430969178676605,-0.0397808700799942,0.008012939244508743,-0.02236786112189293,0.00829269178211689,-0.005222147796303034,-0.07205963879823685,0.07819481194019318,-0.03744076192378998,0.029161693528294563,-0.04986479878425598,0.0521220862865448,0.021014917641878128,-0.04302513226866722,0.004172394052147865,-0.09723715484142303,0.02403423562645912,-0.009548432193696499,0.06309233605861664,0.005721698980778456,0.09415321797132492,-0.009521027095615864,0.027644267305731773,0.0069855633191764355,0.018060188740491867,-0.006690401118248701,-0.03783052787184715,-0.016748404130339622,0.08239106833934784,-0.017652690410614014,0.0907277911901474,0.06039632856845856,0.058292169123888016,-0.12462577223777771,-0.04740653559565544,0.09542663395404816,0.010269626043736935,0.0791797935962677,0.014369693584740162,-0.062178436666727066,-0.055696118623018265,0.007201956119388342,-0.00765683688223362,0.004738910589367151,0.004574463702738285,-0.07741863280534744,0.025363709777593613,0.038360755890607834,-0.030230360105633736,-0.04629029333591461,-0.006599012296646833,-0.08045080304145813,0.017065783962607384,-0.03751816600561142,0.0284812580794096,0.04232713207602501,-0.029768213629722595,0.07968602329492569,-0.01787271350622177,-0.01057819090783596,0.026655958965420723,-0.04669233411550522,-0.01683235354721546,-1.169243108598813e-33,0.1122516542673111,0.022171929478645325,0.10828270018100739,0.05771012231707573,0.05330454185605049,0.022168438881635666,-0.08807875961065292,0.06478379666805267,-0.04651511833071709,-0.02204444445669651,-0.024056345224380493,0.004830040968954563,-0.062309086322784424,0.05606233328580856,-0.006924135144799948,0.0313536562025547,-0.04538246989250183,0.03888687863945961,-0.006890478543937206,0.011652120389044285,-0.0051696449518203735,-0.068822480738163,0.0026214979588985443,0.09822748601436615,0.014587047509849072,0.03025106154382229,0.0773056149482727,-0.05492551997303963,0.011722697876393795,-0.04723111540079117,-0.1380249410867691,-0.04506523534655571,0.0006308890879154205,-0.026263387873768806,0.028181588277220726,-0.06432297080755234,-0.03590845689177513,-0.060470689088106155,0.0016531551955267787,0.01691976934671402,-0.039141297340393066,-0.03386378288269043,0.02891436219215393,-0.005505990702658892,-0.059308744966983795,0.01245959009975195,-0.03286653384566307,0.00019288990006316453,-0.015376010909676552,-0.020350037142634392,0.027014192193746567,0.00959640834480524,-0.04107759892940521,-0.04690328612923622,0.023717112839221954,-0.019937865436077118,-0.013781226240098476,0.046143315732479095,0.029894836246967316,-0.025361590087413788,0.0077118342742323875,0.02332601137459278,0.022926535457372665,0.12563441693782806,0.021049682050943375,0.01962796412408352,-0.06137477234005928,0.06014007702469826,0.09295067191123962,0.028434671461582184,-0.03901304677128792,0.03184795752167702,0.014752358198165894,-0.04487202316522598,-0.016530238091945648,0.04203573614358902,-0.029110386967658997,-0.1343982219696045,0.014845144934952259,0.04105637967586517,-0.03142036870121956,-0.09112116694450378,-0.008967531844973564,-0.05457157641649246,-0.04159612953662872,0.021377086639404297,0.04466725513339043,-0.09547621011734009,0.008118191733956337,-0.055388130247592926,-0.03934367001056671,0.0033796208444982767,-0.04513750225305557,-0.013455549255013466,0.05595337599515915,1.2674012031607935e-33,0.0751357227563858,-0.01802915707230568,-0.0202738456428051,-0.009349880740046501,0.04522598162293434,-0.020863240584731102,0.0075090317986905575,0.053795650601387024,-0.016972318291664124,-0.05075410008430481,0.0003212320734746754,-0.045883938670158386,0.0003844780439976603,-0.057124421

For example, Schema.org creates a standardized vocabulary that enables webmasters to embed structured data on their web pages for applications like search engines; Wikidata, the largest open knowledge graph with data about various entities, concepts, and facts, acts as central storage for the structured data of its Wikimedia sister projects including Wikipedia. However, accessing the Semantic Web is challenging for average users: unlike traditional web browsing, navigating the Semantic Web requires expertise in ontology and query languages. As a result, the Semantic Web remains confined to technical experts, researchers, and specialized applications, limiting its accessibility to a broader population.  To bridge the gap between user intents and structured data, semantic parsing has been used to build question-answering systems. Semantic parsing is the task to convert natural language into logical forms such as query languages, which can be executed to extract information. Traditional approaches to building such systems require substantial amounts of manually annotated data, often making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale.   This thesis introduces a novel synthesis-based methodology to generate large high-quality training data based on the schema and data values given a database or knowledge graph. This approach significantly reduces the cost of building a question-answering agent for the Semantic Web.   To provide full coverage of the query space, we propose a comprehensive template system to synthesize a sample of all possible queries that can be composed with the basic database algebra operators given a schema. The template set is built based on natural language grammar, capturing a wide range of variety including different sentence purposes and parts of speech, minimizing the manual annotation effort and the reliance on paraphrasing. We created the Schema2QA benchmark by crawling Schema.org data from websites in 6 domains, and we show that the semantic parsers trained with our synthetic data and few-shot human paraphrases achieve 64% to 75% accuracy on these domains, outperforming major commercial assistants on these long-tail complex questions by at least 18% while remaining comparable accuracy on the more popular questions.   To further reduce the manual effort, we propose a neural property annotator and a filtered neural paraphraser to the pipeline, enabling bootstrapping a question-answering agent from the database schema fully automatically. We show that the automatically generated parsers achieve an average of 62.9% accuracy, only 6.4% lower than models trained with expert annotations and human paraphrase data, surpassing the state-of-the-art zero-shot models.   To answer open-domain questions, we build a question-answering agent based on the information from Wikidata, the largest open knowledge base for world knowledge. To tackle the scale and sparsity of information in Wikidata, we propose a simplified abstract query representation and an entity-linking approach with failure recovery to improve the performance of the model.  Evaluated on WikiWebQuestions, the first large Wikidata semantic parsing dataset with real-world human-written questions we created, our approach, WikiSP, achieves 69% answer accuracy on the dev set and 59% on the test set, establishing a strong baseline for the benchmark.   In addition, we show that we can pair WikiSP with GPT-3 to provide a combination of verifiable results and qualified guesses that can provide useful answers to 97% of the questions.   In summary, this thesis proposes a novel synthesis-based methodology for question-answering semantic parsing. By leveraging the schema and data values within the databases and knowledge bases, our methodology can substantially reduce the costs of building question-answering agents, thereby paving the way to access to the Semantic Web for a broader population with natural

{"title":"Towards neural graph databases","abstract":"Graph databases are the primary workhorse for storing and organizing structured information over real-world entities. The core task on graph databases is query answering. The objective is to execute a given query of interest and retrieve answers to the query from the underlying graph. However, a major challenge is that data in graph databases are often massive, noisy, and incomplete. Relationships between entities keep changing, which is extremely hard to keep track of. Execution of a query over noisy and missing data leads to answers of poor quality. This significantly limits the application of graph databases in many scenarios. Neural graph query answering algorithms aim to address the challenge via embeddings and representation learning. The idea is to map complex queries and graph data to a latent space. This field has witnessed substantial growth, with extensive research focusing on both theoretical and practical dimensions, addressing various queries and graph types with efficient systems.  In this thesis, we introduce the concept of Neural Graph Databases (NGDBs) where neural graph query answering is at its core. NGDB consists of a Neural Graph Storage and a Neural Graph Engine, extending the idea of graph databases. Under NGDB, we provide a collection of neural graph query answering methods, datasets, systems, metrics, and broad applications. In Chapter 2, we start with the definitions of different types of graphs, graph queries, fuzzy logic, and graph representation learning. This serves as the foundation and background of the thesis. In Part I, we discuss two works on query embeddings, Query2box and BetaE. Query2box introduces the first neural graph query answering algorithm that models existential quantification, disjunction, and conjunction operations. BetaE further extends its capabilities to include the negation operation. In Part II, we design the first and most scalable system, SMORE, which allows for the training of neural graph query answering algorithms on extremely large graphs. In Part III, we introduce the overall framework and components of NGDB. We further provide a unified taxonomy of existing neural graph query answering algorithms from the perspectives of graphs, modeling, queries, and datasets. Together the thesis introduces the task of neural graph query answering and the framework of NGDB, presents two novel algorithms, and points out promising directions, unsolved problems, and applications of

{"title":"Compositional representation learning : from reasoning to synthesis","abstract":"The world we live in is inherently compositional: Just like a sentence is built upon phrases and words, a visual scene comprises a collection of interacting objects and entities, which in turn are derived from the sum of their parts. This compositionality plays a pivotal role in our ability to understand the world, organize the acquired knowledge through a rich set of concepts, and readily adapt them to novel situations and environments. Essentially, it is considered one of the fundamental building blocks of human intelligence. What does compositionality mean in the context of machine intelligence? How can we encourage neural networks to develop structured understanding of our surroundings? And how can we apply this knowledge to improve in downstream tasks of vision and language? These are the key questions that are explored in the dissertation.  We discuss manners and mechanisms to encourage multimodal neural networks to learn compositional scene representations, and in turn operate over them in a compositional manner, which we leverage for two downstream goals: multimodal reasoning, where we introduce models that can draw a sequence of inferences about visual scenes so to answer textual questions about them; and visual synthesis, where a model can inversely generate pictures depicting multi-object scenes from scratch. We fulfill these aims by incorporating a graphical structure into neural networks, which consists of nodes and edges, respectively meant to capture the objects within the scene and the relations among them.  We demonstrate how these graph-based structural priors endow neural networks with multiple desirable properties, including: data efficiency, achieved by decomposing a given task into a series of subtasks, each of which could be learned more easily; generalization, where a model can recombine known concepts together in novel ways; controllability, where modifying respective components of the model's latent representation can selectively induce intended modifications within its output; and interpretability of the computational process the model follows, either to create an image or to reason over it. Throughout this work, we study the interplay and analogies between synthesis and reasoning, and show how, with the right inductive biases incorporated, the former capability could foster the latter.","vector":[0.030169568955898285,-0.11381405591964722,0.07545018196105957,0.037232957780361176,0.09605681151151657,-0.02053617313504219,0.02315007522702217,0.0036610940005630255,0.018404792994260788,-0.04068566486239433,-0.04676027595996857,-0.0970693901181221,0.047255951911211014,0.051323484629392624,0.03211674466729164,0.04222218692302704,0.04370611906051636,0.08374666422605515,-0.12116111069917679,-0.03396032378077507,0.008436696603894234,0.0010376394493505359,0.05744928866624832,-0.024662746116518974,-0.03441369906067848,0.07104344666004181,-0.007177698891609907,-0.07045629620552063,0.0135580999776721,0.001710268552415073,0.08091036230325699,0.034774359315633774,0.0030028647743165493,0.11144135892391205,-0.047643646597862244,0.14391610026359558,0.00696012657135725,0.0731414407491684,-0.018706832081079483,-0.07262440025806427,-0.04261363670229912,-0.02546314336359501,-0.003169065108522773,0.008399464190006256,0.12107163667678833,-0.0010837572626769543,-0.044120434671640396,-0.06998755782842636,0.038500744849443436,0.031049231067299843,-0.19566158950328827,-0.036445215344429016,-0.08623067289590836,0.016479426994919777,-0.014138833619654179,0.07780090719461441,0.019341599196195602,-0.012331975623965263,0.009985518641769886,-0.0008636245038360357,0.02950524352490902,-0.07451702654361725,0.015586117282509804,0.010545250028371811,0.0604863241314888,-0.037452466785907745,-0.0006737412768416107,0.018974948674440384,-0.0425703302025795,0.029686467722058296,0.022825460880994797,0.07481139898300171,-0.019607817754149437,-0.0020670134108513594,-0.05103467404842377,0.07422186434268951,0.020623233169317245,-0.09972650557756424,0.019676052033901215,-0.10469455271959305,0.04547357186675072,0.03512845188379288,0.04443079233169556,0.0203560721129179,0.08281337469816208,0.009772410616278648,-0.018178794533014297,0.08114159107208252,-0.027553744614124298,-0.009365356527268887,-0.09998508542776108,-0.08430568128824234,0.052274640649557114,-0.030533745884895325,0.106602743268013,0.028924856334924698,-0.004198787733912468,-0.12000013142824173,0.06219881772994995,0.07579734921455383,0.01862061582505703,0.04624389857053757,0.01972641609609127,-0.04509974643588066,0.0002679711324162781,0.02392178401350975,0.020243970677256584,0.02469249628484249,0.012405580841004848,-0.09385690093040466,0.02295270375907421,0.03938612714409828,-0.02424047701060772,0.009985162876546383,-0.006943855434656143,-0.04758942127227783,0.057312093675136566,-0.02228003367781639,0.06452829390764236,0.048280637711286545,0.01966051198542118,0.048246078193187714,-0.019213572144508362,0.031635746359825134,0.05541061982512474,-0.08423673361539841,0.018482232466340065,-9.957793561743029e-34,0.03929244354367256,-0.02738598920404911,0.09859458357095718,0.10119407624006271,0.08344767987728119,-0.022243723273277283,0.0015916470438241959,0.037272319197654724,-0.02434558980166912,-0.004092325456440449,0.007596212439239025,-0.03600846603512764,-0.04342217743396759,0.15768040716648102,-0.014688447117805481,-0.041798654943704605,-0.029080204665660858,0.014795457944273949,-0.0008463527774438262,0.009227411821484566,-0.03555973991751671,-0.03523498773574829,-0.005452448967844248,0.023894356563687325,-0.017616698518395424,-0.003409998258575797,0.06506067514419556,-0.08325599133968353,-0.09465411305427551,-0.022497903555631638,-0.11694256961345673,0.007500354666262865,-0.04974135383963585,0.04724113643169403,0.03235644847154617,-0.06337892264127731,-0.03930593281984329,-0.007597935386002064,0.06108282133936882,0.027782902121543884,-0.026470966637134552,-0.019325654953718185,-0.05232498422265053,0.009380257688462734,-0.07731281220912933,0.006870931014418602,0.007764011155813932,0.06704876571893692,-0.058821603655815125,-0.03797581046819687,0.010680204257369041,0.025190891698002815,0.008315877057611942,-0.12085180729627609,-0.0031216773204505444,0.0283161960542202,-0.0019940603524446487,-0.024206433445215225,0.08605524152517319,-0.05787690728902817,-0.015391796827316284,0.09920684248209,-0.05612201988697052,0.0808839350938797,0.0146123506128788,0.059575311839580536,-0.006159388925880194,0.04102329909801483,0.07138325273990631,0.007648767437785864,-0.05580128729343414,0.04492352902889252,-0.030004603788256645,-0.023985043168067932,-0.0035143091809004545,0.05635454133152962,-0.014923306182026863,-0.10845328122377396,-0.011926737613976002,0.0984746515750885,-0.05110299214720726,0.013834720477461815,-0.011497094295918941,-0.028431018814444542,-0.008119535632431507,0.03171277418732643,0.07966502755880356,-0.09688124805688858,0.0021382386330515146,-0.04775821417570114,-0.03494463115930557,-0.09488322585821152,-0.04910530522465706,-0.056437939405441284,0.017527015879750252,-1.5406163960056252e-33,0.027222661301493645,0.02306712418794632,-0.08059068769216537,-0.012674123048782349,-0.029581673443317413,-0.015471279621124268,-0.028963953256607056,0.026905842125415802,-0.028301594778895378,-0.01789904572069645,-0.04751291126012802,0.0021635934244841337,0.0068497429601848125,-0.047

However, harnessing the full potential of biobanks requires innovative methodologies that address challenges in phenotype recognition, genetic association studies, and multimorbidity. First, in order to define the disease cohorts accurately, we must recognize phenotypes that may not be labelled in the primary data. To address this challenge, we developed an AI-based method called POPDx (Population-based Objective Phenotyping by Deep Extrapolation) that computes disease liabilities for 12,803 ICD-10 codes and 1538 Phenotype codes for all participants in the UK Biobank. Second, the genetic data in biobanks are often used to conduct association studies in order to understand the genetic architecture of key health traits. These studies are commonly set up as case-control, but the \"healthy\" may evolve over time and become cases. We demonstrate that our disease liability estimates from patient phenotyping allow us to improve downstream genetic discovery by mapping disease risk to a quantitative scale that provides greater statistical power compared to the dichotomous designs. Finally, multimorbidity (the coexistence of multiple diseases in an individual) provides an opportunity to understand disorders that may share genetic or environmental risk factors. Therefore, we present ForeSITE (Forecasting Susceptibility to Illness with Transformer Embeddings), an automatic framework powered by a GPT-style architecture that models disease trajectories and can predict likely future diseases. These new capabilities, both alone and in combination, enhance the utility of large-scale biobanks for scientific discoveries. In particular, our contributions to phenotype recognition, genetic association studies, and multimorbidity modeling pave the way for improved disease understanding and personalized healthcare

{"title":"Matrix estimation with adaptive samples","abstract":"Datasets commonly have missing values, and in many applications, such as recommendation systems, supervised learning, and causal inference, the data can be modeled as a partially observed matrix and the missing values are imputed via a matrix estimation procedure. Most prior literature focuses on the case when samples are missing uniformly at random. However, in certain applications, the decision-maker can choose which entries of the matrix are observed. In the first part of this dissertation, we show theoretical guarantees on column space recovery of a matrix that is growing in one dimension (new columns are added), where the decision-maker can observe a small number of entries of each column, using either random or active sampling. We demonstrate that the theoretically-motivated active sampling strategy can empirically lead to better estimation of not only the column space, but of the entire matrix. In the second part of this dissertation, we study a related problem where the decision of which entries of each new column to observe is modeled as a multi-armed semi-bandit problem, where we allow the decision-maker to choose multiple actions in each round. We use our matrix estimation techniques to provide regret guarantees when the arm selection is performed via the well-known Thompson sampling

{"title":"Navigating the spinal skeletal stem cell microenvironment : insights for targeted tissue regeneration","abstract":"The intervertebral disc (IVD), also known as the spinal disc, undergoes accelerated degeneration compared to other connective tissues, leading to intervertebral disc degeneration. Addressing this challenge requires effective treatments capable of reversing fibrocartilage damage caused by factors such as age and injury. Tissue-resident stem cells hold promise for IVD treatment due to their self-renewal and differentiation properties. In this dissertation, I will discuss our efforts to identify novel regulators of spinal skeletal stem cell (SSC) differentiation and their role in regenerating IVD tissue in response to injury. Additionally, I will outline a protocol we developed for isolating and functionally assessing human SSCs from various cell and tissue sources. Our basic and preclinical findings lay the foundation for innovative stem cell-based therapies targeting IVD degeneration and other related disorders.","vector":[-0.0675838366150856,-0.07957016676664352,0.035797204822301865,-0.027127837762236595,0.008800258859992027,-0.023955266922712326,-0.07573474943637848,0.01016617938876152,0.03632355481386185,0.07975658774375916,0.00028976271278224885,0.05365569517016411,-0.04883912578225136,0.03464547544717789,-0.05598144605755806,0.06723655015230179,-0.016471557319164276,0.07444576919078827,0.005105096846818924,0.03192128241062164,-0.04073973745107651,0.05042579770088196,0.03122085891664028,-0.002867444884032011,0.034392643719911575,-0.06273767352104187,-0.00010914321319432929,0.026769423857331276,0.01985403522849083,0.017357446253299713,0.0750262662768364,0.018481409177184105,0.057209134101867676,-0.08070340752601624,0.0031131210271269083,-0.030180174857378006,0.03340640291571617,-0.07493558526039124,-0.04471207782626152,-0.049846261739730835,0.03776644915342331,-0.027922164648771286,-0.014944512397050858,-0.012067868374288082,0.05806669592857361,-0.1116107776761055,-0.049297578632831573,-0.09419526159763336,-0.03820919990539551,0.09589232504367828,0.026519151404500008,-0.029017359018325806,7.723730232100934e-05,0.007308032363653183,-0.013873130083084106,0.07609351724386215,-0.015311275608837605,0.03178584575653076,0.05731691047549248,0.04031046852469444,0.025058364495635033,-0.117276132106781,0.05143442749977112,-0.028813157230615616,-0.012171074748039246,0.017014043405652046,0.05928242206573486,-0.023166509345173836,-0.10356359928846359,-0.006635961122810841,-0.04651583731174469,-0.002491480903699994,0.10299018770456314,0.018482213839888573,-0.006819713395088911,-0.0022721157874912024,0.013408694416284561,0.05142511427402496,0.04468364268541336,0.0007641855627298355,-0.04478992894291878,0.058080870658159256,0.028946945443749428,0.06422411650419235,0.01022356003522873,0.039884258061647415,0.010029963217675686,0.08156289905309677,-0.06446456909179688,0.1547018140554428,0.03590502217411995,-0.0310349240899086,-0.019393425434827805,-0.05369776487350464,-0.009744500741362572,0.02465738356113434,-0.04209842532873154,-0.019140880554914474,0.11268973350524902,-0.10163704305887222,-0.04883401840925217,0.03415326029062271,0.015108941122889519,-0.02185049094259739,-0.0011729855323210359,-0.026426607742905617,0.023795049637556076,-0.037425488233566284,-0.0038267308846116066,0.04302801936864853,0.003222925588488579,-0.00126853387337178,-0.05201207101345062,0.08284290134906769,-0.013563706539571285,0.030431702733039856,-0.006160676945000887,-0.008370674215257168,0.11154225468635559,-0.050508756190538406,0.0333908386528492,0.05087552219629288,0.03344772756099701,0.028593407943844795,-0.027843162417411804,0.011093833483755589,0.016682831570506096,1.3818978426797383e-33,0.04055389016866684,0.02028166502714157,-0.05735808610916138,0.06517398357391357,-0.057755373418331146,-0.029692817479372025,-0.0654781311750412,-0.0316409096121788,-0.03286037966609001,0.03666963800787926,-0.05661563575267792,-0.00488762091845274,0.04720410704612732,-0.0024250068236142397,-0.016629988327622414,0.038870491087436676,-0.10956331342458725,-0.04462876915931702,-0.006187166087329388,-0.04828199744224548,0.10059060901403427,0.05743194371461868,0.037587057799100876,-0.03473884239792824,0.04681095480918884,-0.13596346974372864,-0.008271374739706516,0.014477667398750782,0.04903414845466614,-0.018182143568992615,-0.031114276498556137,-0.021197974681854248,0.09503196179866791,-0.07232840359210968,0.040038324892520905,0.06598754972219467,0.04481158405542374,-0.024889953434467316,0.013150747865438461,0.06870128959417343,0.08594746887683868,-0.050950419157743454,0.0023359402548521757,0.029229314997792244,0.006142050493508577,-0.032805632799863815,-0.029684647917747498,-0.0519607849419117,-0.02841336652636528,-0.09383371472358704,-0.03743224963545799,0.10222162306308746,0.015045199543237686,-0.06416173279285431,-0.08443406224250793,-0.007098833564668894,-0.10849595814943314,-0.07292204350233078,-0.014117628335952759,0.026627421379089355,-0.05535421893000603,-0.08117327839136124,-0.03346465155482292,0.08358835428953171,-0.0030879697296768427,-0.010980848222970963,-0.025130508467555046,-0.021693050861358643,-0.0955306887626648,-0.025006696581840515,0.058455582708120346,-0.08105412125587463,2.797902561724186e-05,-0.0025778375566005707,-0.03480157256126404,0.004448064602911472,-0.0050193085335195065,0.11418595165014267,-0.05506201460957527,-0.047653038054704666,-0.047214314341545105,0.009336093440651894,-0.18842343986034393,0.03378447890281677,0.10586073249578476,-0.03349197283387184,-0.043990883976221085,-0.042243827134370804,0.037913791835308075,-0.08922519534826279,0.010978755541145802,-0.08291053026914597,-0.01808025874197483,0.018504735082387924,-0.008194291032850742,-4.176739711376874e-33,-0.02798423171043396,0.049531955271959305,0.012097415514290333,-0.002793906955048442,-0.03195981681346893,0.047675929963588715,0.02017335593700409,0.06699283421039581,-0.0016541189979761839,-0.07120072096586227,-0.011186009272933006,0.05720526725053787,-0.04405879

{"title":"Microfluidic methods to probe basophils for food allergy diagnostic applications","abstract":"Basophils are rare (~1% of peripheral blood leukocytes), yet potent effector cells that initiate and perpetuate a wide range of immunological responses. In particular, the role of basophils in food allergy is widely studied and has led to the emergence of a highly accurate ex vivo diagnostic test for food allergy: the basophil activation test (BAT). In contrast to commonly used food allergy diagnostic tests, i.e., skin prick test (SPT), allergen specific IgE (sIgE) measurement, and oral food challenge (OFC), the BAT provides highly sensitive and specific results (more than 90% across a range of allergens) while not subjecting individuals to potentially unsafe outcomes (e.g., anaphylaxis). Furthermore, basophil reactivity measured with BAT correlates well with severity and can be used to predict allergen thresholds that elicit a reaction in OFC.  Despite the advantages of BAT over other methods, translating it to common clinical practice has been hampered.  Motivated by the potential that BAT presents for changing the paradigm of food allergy diagnostics, my thesis dissertation focuses on various microfluidic approaches and aspects of measuring basophil activation that aim to increase clinical accessibility to BAT and to other future assays that probe basophil function. First, I investigated the utility of avidin as a basophil activation marker to evaluate whether avidin could enhance the predictive capability of BAT. Next, I developed various methods for rapid immunomagnetic isolation of basophils from whole blood to enable BAT-based diagnostic approaches and research that require purified basophils. Finally, I developed and characterized a novel device and analysis pipeline for increasing the clinical accessibility to BAT. Where applicable, I used computational methods to inform the design of the devices and analyzed data with machine

The study delves into the transport behaviors of capillary-driven boiling and the development of micro-coolers with three-dimensional manifolds, aiming for scalability and energy efficiency. It introduces random-packed copper inverse opals (CIO) as effective wick materials that enhance cooling by optimizing the critical heat flux and thermal resistance. Through semi-analytical modeling, experimental setups like the suspended micro-bridge, and computation fluid dynamics (CFS), the research analyzes steady-state boiling, critical heat flux, and the thermal transients of capillary-driven systems.  Additionally, the thesis details the creation of large-area, chip-scale evaporative micro-coolers using CIO films, demonstrating their ability to handle high heat fluxes efficiently while minimizing energy consumption. The interaction between wick structures, manifold designs, and operational conditions such as flow rates is examined to optimize micro-cooler performance. The study also investigates the integration of fluidized metal-organic frameworks (MOF-303) for water harvesting using waste heat from data centers, enhancing the sustainability of cooling processes. This approach not only conserves water but also leverages thermal outputs for additional environmental benefits, illustrating the potential of combined energy and water management strategies in

{"title":"Functional genomic screening reveals regulators of galectin-1 intracellular trafficking with applications to cellular delivery of new therapeutic modalities","abstract":"Many novel modalities like small-interfering RNA (siRNA), CRISPR, and recombinant proteins have revolutionized biological research, but their applicability in the clinic remains limited. These massive and often highly charged molecules cannot cross the lipophilic cell membrane, and methods for delivering these molecules to the cell interior in a clinical setting are a key bottleneck to their translation. As introduced in Chapter 1, nearly all methods for delivering biomolecules to cells rely in some way on a cell's own trafficking machinery and the glycan-binding protein galectin-1 is able to traffic from the cell surface to the cell interior via an unknown mechanism. Thus, to address this challenge, we shed new light on the trafficking of galectin-1 and explore the possibility of hijacking this trafficking system to deliver therapeutic molecules.  Functional genomics represents a powerful new set of tools for mechanistic investigation of biological phenomena in an unbiased manner. In Chapter 2, we explore and prototype selection methodologies that would enable us to leverage genome-wide CRISPR screening to study galectin-1 trafficking. Chapter 3 describes the use of a galectin-1-toxin conjugate, modelled on antibody-drug conjugates, as a selection tool in a genome-wide CRISPR screen and discusses the resulting data.  Next, in Chapter 4, we validate the results of the screen and perform a deeper investigation into the pathways followed by exogenous galectin-1 when it enters cells. We discover that galectin-1 interacts with the endosome-lysosome trafficking receptor sortilin in a glycan-dependent manner and that this interaction regulates galectin-1 trafficking to the lysosome. Finally, in Chapter 5, we show that the galectin-1 trafficking pathway can be exploited for delivery of a functional siRNA. Taken together, our work illuminates the mechanisms by which galectin-1 is internalized by cells and suggests a new strategy for intracellular drug delivery via galectin-1 conjugation.","vector":[-0.0800209566950798,-0.07175450772047043,-0.01805521547794342,0.029746180400252342,0.0418379083275795,-0.012182692065834999,0.011125237680971622,-0.0035532957408577204,0.04992504045367241,0.0041108825244009495,-0.04741067811846733,0.01000489667057991,-0.03766768053174019,0.10303105413913727,-0.07219883799552917,0.047900404781103134,-0.021782375872135162,0.011891248635947704,-0.06699421256780624,-0.00543177267536521,0.03576656058430672,0.01704924739897251,-0.04822218418121338,-0.01940172165632248,-0.02627020701766014,-0.04018029570579529,-0.031209371984004974,-0.04337790608406067,-0.09094993025064468,-0.08349093794822693,0.022089125588536263,0.005271635949611664,-0.06186050549149513,0.019715406000614166,-0.04024062305688858,0.017415208742022514,0.02166988141834736,0.03503608703613281,-0.005179862026125193,-0.07717686146497726,0.11503813415765762,-0.000504723284393549,-0.016352059319615364,-0.002666700165718794,0.044488921761512756,-0.06472573429346085,-0.03278191387653351,0.005423056893050671,0.09858785569667816,0.05117182061076164,-0.022712716832756996,-0.01943153887987137,-0.050994910299777985,0.08080349862575531,0.008803202770650387,0.062262099236249924,-0.005832625087350607,-0.04126933217048645,0.07110566645860672,-0.002754608867689967,-0.004402416758239269,-0.03511955589056015,0.03980692848563194,0.017502620816230774,-0.0197403896600008,-0.12532198429107666,0.06998241692781448,0.0047172368504107,-0.022577472031116486,0.058663565665483475,0.017759786918759346,0.03936562314629555,-0.08602025359869003,0.02118263952434063,0.11042717099189758,0.04535732790827751,-0.03918049484491348,0.01627272553741932,0.04067195951938629,-0.053893230855464935,0.0772913470864296,0.004421107470989227,0.0803426131606102,0.08597102761268616,0.031619105488061905,0.06152690201997757,0.021919364109635353,-0.020001890137791634,-0.017469393089413643,-0.01149444468319416,-0.008755340240895748,-0.09779738634824753,0.03521253913640976,0.0017263359623029828,-0.08514122664928436,0.053017839789390564,0.04485911875963211,-0.049416325986385345,0.021564004942774773,0.010100878775119781,-0.015402885153889656,-0.010562149807810783,0.008647918701171875,-0.05231460556387901,0.007913729175925255,-0.007834479212760925,0.007071621250361204,0.016544966027140617,0.011903430335223675,0.0077118054032325745,0.03859352320432663,0.018724560737609863,0.07203452289104462,0.03202992305159569,-0.0011890900786966085,0.005984670482575893,0.018201621249318123,0.044216737151145935,0.07575149834156036,0.091417595744133,0.034121930599212646,0.02004341222345829,-0.03641581907868385,0.007076277397572994,-0.02858438529074192,0.039283350110054016,-0.08311017602682114,1.544530516687375e-33,0.009322360157966614,-0.018382297828793526,0.061441726982593536,0.1202576532959938,-0.006477578543126583,-0.12027197331190109,-0.01644708216190338,-0.04646513983607292,-0.03603358939290047,0.02348409779369831,-0.06346069276332855,-0.04999794065952301,-0.027579206973314285,0.10362071543931961,-0.0036918134428560734,0.016480447724461555,-0.07112310826778412,-0.041352055966854095,-0.02819303423166275,-0.018025217577815056,-0.05992487072944641,0.011818164959549904,-0.0038797298911958933,-0.09732718765735626,0.08163066953420639,-0.021761778742074966,-0.0043973298743367195,-0.053601350635290146,0.08777786046266556,0.0011341802310198545,-0.12022337317466736,0.02821573242545128,0.026192374527454376,0.09370429068803787,0.020353326573967934,0.06521214544773102,0.025662371888756752,-0.10087092220783234,0.006703012157231569,-0.0363742858171463,-0.008628134615719318,0.043344687670469284,-0.10725129395723343,-0.06274930387735367,0.007194628939032555,-0.01717064343392849,-0.05120141804218292,0.012753679417073727,-0.05918345972895622,-0.02831355296075344,0.033171989023685455,0.007499095052480698,0.0441555418074131,-0.03430856019258499,-0.029536835849285126,-0.03823595866560936,-0.0211586132645607,-0.05791935324668884,0.007648486644029617,0.02631204016506672,0.03721544146537781,-0.018442705273628235,-0.04406736046075821,0.08967597782611847,0.02716105431318283,-0.014853790402412415,-0.05870010331273079,-0.03985123336315155,-0.007099991664290428,0.024784134700894356,-0.056583087891340256,0.03233771771192551,0.04421640932559967,-0.017508914694190025,0.0030826074071228504,-0.04811063036322594,0.0999022126197815,0.044637154787778854,0.020329756662249565,-0.0007586203864775598,0.07621991634368896,-0.01507296971976757,-0.053089771419763565,0.06179513782262802,-0.10749626159667969,-0.09908196330070496,0.0163325946778059,-0.05227157846093178,-0.07498633861541748,0.017250321805477142,0.0013499832712113857,-0.008166750892996788,-0.01781311258673668,-0.012079726904630661,-0.05766206607222557,-4.1438750933797905e-33,-0.017334844917058945,-0.039735451340675354,0.1001250371336937,0.02137051150202751,-0.06456022709608078,0.06675463169813156,-0.018766125664114952,-0.07823548465967178,0.056332703679800034,-0.06004743278026581,0.03479315713047981,-0.03398586064577103,0.02578890137374401,-0.062972

{"title":"Enabling agile hardware development with the PEak programming language","abstract":"Domain-specific languages for hardware can significantly enhance designer productivity, but sometimes at the cost of ease of verification. On the other hand, ISA specification languages are too static to be used during early stage design space exploration. This dissertation presents PEak, an open-source hardware design and specification language, which aims to improve both design productivity and verification capability. PEak does this by providing a single source of truth for functional models, formal specifications, and RTL. PEak has been used in several academic projects, and PEak-generated RTL has been included in multiple fabricated hardware accelerators. In these projects, the formal capabilities of PEak were crucial for enabling both novel design space exploration techniques and automated compiler synthesis.","vector":[-0.08970361202955246,0.05355769768357277,0.014624694362282753,0.012586104683578014,-0.02832055650651455,-0.12087062746286392,-0.028656557202339172,0.041786350309848785,-0.0482783317565918,-0.06512215733528137,-0.0586935356259346,-0.0853167474269867,-0.0028132295701652765,0.034695714712142944,0.03403259813785553,-0.0017790680285543203,-0.02230330929160118,-0.015007352456450462,0.003937022294849157,-0.0932050421833992,0.04178332909941673,-0.00018838010146282613,-0.028134940192103386,-0.000151103813550435,0.007942738011479378,0.04676958546042442,0.08787272870540619,-0.034190304577350616,0.06336703151464462,-0.04420528560876846,0.03616080805659294,0.020688479766249657,0.03385770320892334,-0.02578883059322834,0.05148927867412567,0.06529082357883453,0.04440883919596672,-0.07775045931339264,-0.0013514398597180843,-0.08972786366939545,-0.10610709339380264,-0.06433090567588806,0.027990149334073067,0.06069878116250038,0.02242124266922474,-0.023255908861756325,0.019652292132377625,-0.022119589149951935,-0.09721916168928146,0.032878097146749496,-0.07682729512453079,-0.0540228933095932,0.029557501897215843,-0.0968180000782013,-0.03068375214934349,0.07624785602092743,0.05280016362667084,-0.011254752054810524,0.028807496652007103,0.034019362181425095,-0.06074872240424156,-0.02359657920897007,-0.053027983754873276,0.00041755218990147114,-0.030697952955961227,0.05813375487923622,0.0013341474113985896,-0.00820233952254057,0.09227260202169418,0.04398629069328308,-0.06831948459148407,-0.05593327805399895,0.03431892767548561,0.05638527497649193,0.02690381184220314,0.006486621685326099,0.050411075353622437,-0.05644788593053818,0.003868289291858673,-0.06366784125566483,-0.0014438049402087927,-0.017569009214639664,-0.06639450043439865,-0.013956497423350811,0.0414559505879879,0.04160898178815842,-0.030062714591622353,0.04763205349445343,0.04819703474640846,0.00018592708511278033,0.018186848610639572,-0.03531501069664955,0.03511078655719757,-0.007418972440063953,0.06446655094623566,0.02042684145271778,0.0011377377668395638,-0.07909535616636276,0.002720967400819063,0.04802124202251434,-0.07202858477830887,0.0184085201472044,0.038059696555137634,0.020314941182732582,-0.06117617338895798,-0.010097657330334187,-0.01228918693959713,0.07889682054519653,-0.10196775943040848,-0.056086037307977676,0.038463544100522995,-0.0159483440220356,0.046463463455438614,-0.07525366544723511,0.035558559000492096,0.029540928080677986,-0.09124970436096191,-0.022685401141643524,0.06601119041442871,-0.0041876486502587795,-0.04485167935490608,-0.03206305578351021,-0.025007911026477814,0.06636311113834381,0.01968640275299549,-0.039682596921920776,-0.09436269849538803,9.032160637092596e-34,0.03225049749016762,0.061247099190950394,-0.044805124402046204,0.09791442006826401,-0.0018615417648106813,-0.09354621171951294,0.08560876548290253,0.02902856282889843,-0.059707529842853546,0.005352356005460024,0.05894329026341438,0.0055329459719359875,-0.05796929448843002,0.06670955568552017,0.07387498021125793,-0.02878151647746563,0.06246976554393768,0.06423486024141312,-0.06571456044912338,0.007584713865071535,0.02589280903339386,0.01333102397620678,0.008504312485456467,-0.018758276477456093,0.01573348231613636,0.09300734847784042,-0.0033164536580443382,-0.007822810672223568,-0.08127252757549286,0.01411956176161766,-0.030714664608240128,0.009553510695695877,0.04035918414592743,0.034694403409957886,0.028240259736776352,0.04063817113637924,-0.005798444151878357,-0.06347441673278809,0.08102007210254669,0.042754508554935455,0.023168466985225677,0.07949784398078918,-0.001676873187534511,-0.007190011441707611,-0.02213672362267971,0.031285107135772705,0.013733967207372189,0.023857610300183296,0.009406250901520252,-0.03258754312992096,0.015482446178793907,0.11663459241390228,0.022299939766526222,-0.002333938842639327,0.08334964513778687,-0.07867706567049026,-0.02763189934194088,0.04600011184811592,0.10280882567167282,0.22908549010753632,-0.10541019588708878,0.09082729369401932,-0.04295298457145691,-0.0072938608936965466,-0.08047473430633545,0.02378331869840622,-0.002726418897509575,0.013104506768286228,0.013181260786950588,0.059280768036842346,-0.0207056924700737,0.028621556237339973,0.019722608849406242,0.01493501104414463,0.016157671809196472,0.006989633664488792,0.020171068608760834,-0.038328155875205994,-0.026108067482709885,-0.031077364459633827,-0.04450436681509018,0.08950577676296234,0.02457321248948574,0.05589734762907028,0.04660928621888161,-0.05270622298121452,-0.01511845737695694,0.008751988410949707,-0.0506601519882679,-0.0364602766931057,-0.05916587635874748,-0.024145659059286118,0.014049818739295006,0.014254067093133926,-0.0010377726284787059,-2.5246521962732288e-33,0.02854355052113533,-0.05919233709573746,-0.0247572660446167,0.005922291893512011,-0.12708327174186707,-0.09109818935394287,-0.043888214975595474,-0.06360290944576263,-0.006741730961948633,0.046408046036958694,0.06900005787611008,-0.04392511397600174,0.051050424575805664,0.00044283215

{"title":"Beyond text : applying deep learning to signal data","abstract":"Sequence modeling primitives have been responsible for breakthroughs across domains like natural language processing and genomics. Despite these advances, existing primitives still struggle to model the large class of signal data acquired from physical sensors. This data has unique characteristics that make it challenging to model: signal data resolution affects the training and generalization of models, signal data is sampled at high rates, resulting in dense data with long-range dependencies, and signal data is highly diverse, with application areas including healthcare, video processing, and industrial sensing. All of these properties raise the bar for universal approaches to modeling this data. This thesis develops a new set of approaches for modeling signal data using state space models. First, we introduce a sequence model called S4 that serves as a general building block for modeling signal data. Second, we generalize this modeling layer to multidimensional signals like images and videos, yielding the first state-of-the-art signal model on large-scale benchmarks such as ImageNet. Incorporating S4 into a multiscale architecture makes it possible to model extremely long sequences of audio, including on a previously unsolved task involving unconditional autoregressive generation of raw audio samples. Finally, we demonstrate the widespread applicability of our approach to a variety of signal data, including a real-world application involving impedance sensor data used in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Taken together, this new set of approaches provides a universal and versatile set of primitives for modeling diverse, multidimensional signals.","vector":[-0.08436335623264313,-0.13572077453136444,0.03711821511387825,-0.01838645339012146,0.052437931299209595,0.091805100440979,-0.07711806148290634,-0.053327273577451706,0.03787177428603172,-0.1038590520620346,-0.0271291621029377,-0.0558796301484108,-0.06518912315368652,0.06953389197587967,-0.048644762486219406,-0.08337701112031937,0.02648513950407505,0.042383987456560135,-0.07775704562664032,-0.08179657906293869,0.07204669713973999,0.0597347617149353,0.02060093730688095,0.037031181156635284,0.04888658598065376,0.06101952865719795,0.05556849017739296,-0.04677595570683479,-0.01653842255473137,0.026500064879655838,0.10073928534984589,0.010986857116222382,0.09918452054262161,-0.006141742691397667,-0.034686002880334854,-0.016369756311178207,0.004241802264004946,-0.03242507204413414,-0.05006521940231323,-0.028619062155485153,0.09604096412658691,0.024243364110589027,0.03833182156085968,0.025470560416579247,0.04559199512004852,-0.05546664819121361,0.03581257164478302,-0.11455760151147842,0.03871855139732361,0.035088520497083664,-0.05559650436043739,0.04014547914266586,-0.015104695223271847,0.13142399489879608,-0.0402413047850132,-0.04104266315698624,0.014850420877337456,-0.03219735994935036,-0.012365300208330154,-0.0006106548244133592,0.052658360451459885,-0.11835429817438126,0.00229202420450747,-0.06000469997525215,-0.02043968439102173,0.023817161098122597,0.024483468383550644,0.03236522153019905,0.004207426682114601,0.0321427658200264,-0.1103082224726677,0.053547199815511703,-0.027374736964702606,0.08120569586753845,-0.027567140758037567,-0.0011948393657803535,0.06459874659776688,-0.024839071556925774,0.05783122405409813,-0.1039213016629219,0.004624669440090656,-0.014770113863050938,0.05730564147233963,-0.031338002532720566,0.03143221512436867,0.055359747260808945,-0.013786771334707737,-0.003362448886036873,0.035925447940826416,-0.005651992745697498,-0.13548727333545685,-0.08519161492586136,0.040600184351205826,-0.028092537075281143,0.04503083601593971,0.07400809228420258,0.0023161876015365124,-0.07309017330408096,0.059788040816783905,0.04514008015394211,0.04813771694898605,0.02275773324072361,-0.013161834329366684,0.05111074820160866,0.07481113076210022,-0.04489320144057274,0.0017150880303233862,0.04250511899590492,-0.006048204377293587,-0.02502533048391342,0.04920237883925438,0.010800916701555252,0.011813589371740818,0.055482134222984314,0.055292557924985886,-0.06061001867055893,-0.017038604244589806,-0.07466542720794678,-0.013761480338871479,0.055378276854753494,-0.03745323047041893,-0.06342191249132156,-0.0736360177397728,0.05856804549694061,0.041355933994054794,0.0026070147287100554,-0.04222701117396355,2.253776053515541e-33,0.008174601942300797,0.014884459786117077,0.11778338998556137,0.09034451842308044,0.03898421674966812,-0.02067800983786583,-0.015923479571938515,0.04151823744177818,-0.0015785094583407044,0.09648308902978897,-0.03597481548786163,-0.012392470613121986,-0.05407579243183136,0.04892422631382942,0.011745373718440533,0.003734813304618001,-0.07180461287498474,0.03510139137506485,0.05375850573182106,0.02882850542664528,-0.009725834242999554,-0.02455133944749832,-0.010816679336130619,0.022993385791778564,0.028971338644623756,0.03872854262590408,0.0374085009098053,-0.0227607823908329,-0.013973519206047058,-0.011125674471259117,-0.0879555195569992,0.004587200004607439,0.06801586598157883,-0.006989890243858099,0.0806482657790184,-0.027549857273697853,0.036251261830329895,-0.011625015176832676,-0.01051963772624731,-0.06217072159051895,-0.0009078432340174913,0.04414347559213638,0.010027384385466576,-0.03834623843431473,-0.07930783927440643,-0.06817610561847687,0.007528719026595354,0.016599034890532494,-0.05712669715285301,-0.013607515022158623,0.10689481347799301,0.02636239118874073,-0.02295107953250408,-0.06755395978689194,-0.05551758036017418,-0.023100614547729492,0.005567251238971949,0.01667735166847706,0.015175451524555683,0.0594366118311882,-0.009572363458573818,-0.0032298907171934843,0.030544444918632507,0.05316749960184097,0.06908785551786423,-0.0010058213956654072,-0.003880010452121496,0.08117895573377609,-0.012289388105273247,0.019074488431215286,0.04111505299806595,0.03794873133301735,-0.01877058856189251,-0.07689624279737473,0.05182717740535736,0.03788044676184654,0.027688471600413322,-0.0781681165099144,-0.09191779792308807,0.09199613332748413,-0.01676322892308235,0.01104472205042839,0.005273339804261923,-0.02230277843773365,-0.028965946286916733,0.0025615922641009092,-0.0025155500043183565,-0.10027570277452469,-0.04655911400914192,-0.114650659263134,-0.09712846577167511,0.05937374010682106,-0.02463657595217228,-0.001030307961627841,-0.021582016721367836,-2.7056946730181772e-33,0.055288199335336685,0.07286465167999268,-0.025680458173155785,-0.004818474408239126,-0.019090767949819565,-0.06356438994407654,0.02709798328578472,0.08944728225469589,0.012488214299082756,-0.05167365446686745,0.03941875696182251,-0.10131847113370895,0.09079784154891968,0.0038994490168988705,0.006505

{"title":"Probabilistic inference in the era of large models","abstract":"Recent progression in generative artificial intelligence has witnessed a ballooning in model size and data dimensionality. These large models, however, come with increased computational demands which prohibit the use of many traditional probabilistic inference algorithms. There is a pressing need for new inference algorithms that are efficient enough to run on large models and modern architectures, and powerful enough to work with high dimensionalities and large datasets. In this dissertation, we address this challenge by designing algorithms using ingredients that are compatible with model scale, such as parallelization, amortized inference, and neural function approximations. We present a variety of techniques to improve sampling and inference, leading to faster sample speed, better flexibility of sample queries, and more accurate estimation of inference targets. Our methods are applicable to large models across a range of architectures such as diffusion, autoregressive, and masked-autoencoder models. We demonstrate these findings on applications spanning image and text generation, game-playing, and robotics domains. These insights lead to practical improvements and novel perspectives for efficiently deploying large-scale generative models.","vector":[-0.05006475746631622,-0.1197904646396637,0.05288596823811531,0.045586276799440384,0.036982569843530655,0.04820100963115692,-0.03897041827440262,-0.013981021009385586,0.04967401176691055,-0.03742506727576256,-0.028874799609184265,-0.11153161525726318,0.005904090590775013,0.032773811370134354,-0.017299823462963104,0.023066634312272072,0.07281649857759476,0.10660924017429352,-0.10357683897018433,-0.08223387598991394,0.0326506607234478,0.024308038875460625,0.04149467498064041,-0.03156081587076187,0.09185171127319336,-0.007814867421984673,0.010213811881840229,-0.05939893051981926,0.003309424966573715,-0.014794118702411652,0.04817991331219673,-0.02050420269370079,-0.042038239538669586,0.028553124517202377,-0.019739771261811256,0.05712122470140457,-0.08738452196121216,0.048350002616643906,0.07015422731637955,-0.05099520832300186,0.043993934988975525,-0.012668123468756676,0.033052898943424225,0.005454340483993292,0.08567061275243759,-0.01618959940969944,-0.025942090898752213,-0.033765748143196106,0.05744439736008644,0.05354200303554535,-0.06946833431720734,-0.023445801809430122,-0.027858370915055275,0.03363349288702011,0.014392685145139694,0.002562357112765312,0.05922863632440567,0.0037380647845566273,0.04757450148463249,0.02309558168053627,-0.06451486796140671,-0.10160013288259506,0.01449387427419424,-0.019136779010295868,-0.06292880326509476,-0.042458757758140564,0.028831370174884796,0.0423954501748085,-0.0066330949775874615,0.0475187823176384,0.060963209718465805,0.08621346205472946,-0.0733603835105896,0.009047748520970345,0.05396806821227074,-0.0038728753570467234,0.0057102288119494915,-0.10045287758111954,0.060776516795158386,-0.10072589665651321,-0.015876086428761482,-0.06087984889745712,0.03205536678433418,0.03487277403473854,0.08495891094207764,0.03560108318924904,0.027740824967622757,0.09547287970781326,0.012964830733835697,0.0006759886746294796,-0.09908037632703781,-0.016650937497615814,-0.02936474420130253,-0.007713788188993931,0.018788587301969528,0.02789972722530365,-0.007880785502493382,-0.1086701974272728,-0.020685840398073196,0.09303396940231323,-0.006999101955443621,0.07512515783309937,0.056781984865665436,-0.022823777049779892,0.01950218714773655,-0.045939695090055466,0.06810867041349411,0.1137668639421463,-0.007600669749081135,-0.08888819068670273,0.048636917024850845,0.04775502532720566,0.03118213638663292,0.04885833337903023,0.03602372109889984,-0.07328688353300095,0.02132328599691391,-0.04220111295580864,0.04448457434773445,0.06429923325777054,0.010938786901533604,0.07010458409786224,-0.06022254005074501,0.03469562157988548,0.04392334818840027,-0.02195114642381668,-0.03636063262820244,9.595604466800489e-34,0.016423845663666725,0.015164913609623909,0.09591182321310043,0.056575991213321686,0.03958405554294586,0.004914050456136465,0.041910793632268906,0.023422276601195335,-0.0029093597549945116,0.03449667617678642,-0.09790890663862228,-0.010274956934154034,-0.11874328553676605,0.13477174937725067,0.0879572331905365,-0.02566382847726345,-0.054510392248630524,0.05376003682613373,0.020395634695887566,-0.0012180085759609938,0.035801373422145844,-0.03549905866384506,-0.024050284177064896,0.024536389857530594,-0.04858925938606262,-0.009912023320794106,0.03590795770287514,-0.0247673150151968,-0.03167051076889038,-0.0006029459764249623,-0.1382332295179367,0.002136931987479329,-0.02056938223540783,0.019178245216608047,0.03938400000333786,-0.02509986236691475,-0.016653332859277725,-0.020016832277178764,-0.05586139112710953,0.010794461704790592,-0.004238723311573267,0.027316389605402946,0.009846800938248634,-0.02625364437699318,-0.16838182508945465,-0.06506401300430298,0.008058711886405945,-0.011861152946949005,0.015792110934853554,-0.026993751525878906,0.11289025098085403,-0.0005806978442706168,-0.005943099968135357,-0.037082649767398834,0.015265046618878841,-0.041216906160116196,-0.03165529668331146,-0.01080821268260479,0.09390049427747726,0.03884071484208107,0.019411318004131317,-0.014158512465655804,0.009478114545345306,0.06351792067289352,0.04515581578016281,0.03048226423561573,0.004537238273769617,0.006339557934552431,0.05013555288314819,0.0006788327009417117,0.045199934393167496,0.021498175337910652,-0.035186391323804855,-0.10763462632894516,0.05944041162729263,0.04014068469405174,0.009114790707826614,-0.10790926963090897,-0.009911403059959412,0.03272523358464241,-0.06903299689292908,-0.03617208078503609,-0.07651272416114807,-0.02807946689426899,-0.0008983935113064945,-0.04001645743846893,0.05189714580774307,-0.0722239762544632,-0.02091754414141178,-0.010659045539796352,-0.1035165786743164,-0.05609811842441559,-0.015532532706856728,-0.03456640988588333,-0.020103272050619125,-1.0219861762064204e-33,-0.0619143582880497,0.0008042359841056168,0.00945011805742979,0.056964945048093796,-0.03924744948744774,-0.07240613549947739,-0.03465941175818443,0.024440627545118332,-0.0034922666382044554,-0.1272212117910385,-0.06609537452459335,0.03289243206381798,0.07180847227573395,-0.021725349128246

{"title":"The  cyber spiral? : operational and political implications of emerging domains of warfare","abstract":"This project examines how international actors send, receive, interpret, attribute, predict, and act on information about their opponents during security crises, with special consideration to conflict involving emerging domains such as cyberspace. The first paper baselines how states perceive each other's images to determine if there are patterns of perception and misperception in these interpretations. This paper uses content analysis of historical wargames from the Cold War to evaluate how states convey and interpret images of resolve. It finds that strategic misperception is very common, and that actors are more likely to underestimate opponents' images of resolve than overestimate them. It also finds little evidence that significant game moves, often described as signals, effectively shift prior assumptions or beliefs; this suggests that assumptions, biases, and other priors are likely drivers of misperception. The second and third papers use scenario-based survey experiments of elite practitioners to establish how decision-makers consider traditional versus emerging technological domains to (1) interpret the intent of adversary actions and (2) assess and assume risk under conditions of uncertainty. These two papers find that practitioners view military actions in cyberspace with many of the characteristics the literature typically ascribes to signals, and that these practitioners view cyber activity as decidedly less escalatory than kinetic activity. We also find that technological uncertainty has almost no effect on the calculus of decision-makers, but assessments of escalatory risk are highly important. Further, almost all US military respondents coalesce in roughly equal numbers around three distinct decision constructs with distinct logics. The surveys reveal a great chasm between US military and US public decision-making involving emerging technologies.

{"title":"Engineering self-assembling superantigen as cancer immunotherapy","abstract":"Superantigens are the most potent immune activating molecules known in nature. As such, they hold unique potential in the field of cancer immunotherapy, where treatments demand vigorous stimulation of the immune system. Studies in immunotherapy point to a tension between two opposing factors: the need to increase effectiveness while decreasing adverse reactions. Superantigens provide an avenue for a magnified boosting of the immune system, but likewise necessitate greater molecular control and precision to leverage this capacity. This thesis focuses on utilizing computational tools to propose a novel method for introducing molecular logic gate control into an existing superantigen, and consequently harness the unique ability of these proteins while providing a mechanism for control. In the first chapter, we begin with a review of the molecular interactions and strategies behind existing superantigen therapies. We then leverage the computational protein design program RosettaRemodel in chapter two in order to design the molecular logic gates AND and NOT into a superantigen through creating a novel fusion protein between the Mycoplasma Arthritidis Mitogen superantigen and the TIM (triose-phosphate isomerase) barrel. Next, in chapter three we express a focused library of computational solutions and identify the optimal conditions for production and characterization of an ideal design. Finally, in chapter four we experimentally test and quantify the anti-tumor activity of our designed superantigen through both in vitro and in vivo studies, ending with conclusion of our work in chapter five.","vector":[-0.031786978244781494,-0.07983884960412979,-0.11997959017753601,-0.06817460060119629,-0.08955643326044083,0.010648531839251518,-0.002328106900677085,0.039614878594875336,-0.0011083089048042893,0.03109915740787983,0.030888251960277557,0.03168634697794914,-0.012570278719067574,0.06204890459775925,-0.05629117414355278,0.134939044713974,-0.04802967607975006,0.03735515847802162,-0.03373614326119423,-0.05701076611876488,0.07045246660709381,-0.030870888382196426,-0.01698797382414341,0.040277060121297836,-0.08002960681915283,0.01004783809185028,-0.029945455491542816,-0.0017869550501927733,-0.014392741955816746,-0.013975398615002632,0.01704893447458744,-0.09273036569356918,-0.04881132394075394,-0.06897523999214172,-0.04815475642681122,0.0049290587194263935,-0.02293829433619976,0.05294162034988403,-0.0069972737692296505,-0.07317937165498734,-0.002854999853298068,-0.04798274487257004,-0.030550958588719368,-0.035320673137903214,0.035235896706581116,0.003656142856925726,-0.06668120622634888,0.023959359154105186,0.0980970486998558,0.030344095081090927,-0.02755071222782135,0.019081681966781616,-0.00030874519143253565,0.01937507465481758,0.07788576185703278,-0.0030382254626601934,-0.08400353044271469,-0.02095668762922287,-0.008089125156402588,-0.05745295435190201,-0.049645908176898956,-0.08188743144273758,-0.012573402374982834,0.0229481253772974,0.06496593356132507,-0.007108722347766161,-0.0047041685320436954,0.01374904066324234,-0.04883137717843056,0.036494866013526917,-0.01930081658065319,0.0011978968977928162,-0.0052251024171710014,0.08671996742486954,0.10612894594669342,-0.003698040032759309,0.0137573117390275,0.036859143525362015,0.05469634756445885,0.022465888410806656,0.07182655483484268,0.04058094322681427,0.07568414509296417,0.07560470700263977,-0.0063402303494513035,-0.01657159999012947,-0.017020368948578835,0.009468212723731995,0.12266138941049576,-0.017224475741386414,0.04597907513380051,-0.022109301760792732,0.03156295418739319,-0.045889537781476974,0.006960689555853605,0.04064153879880905,0.04346902295947075,-0.03136192634701729,0.021995294839143753,0.04209570214152336,0.04009366035461426,-0.09328725934028625,-0.09041597694158554,-0.05181612819433212,0.08879260718822479,0.032178498804569244,0.03183365613222122,0.03954894095659256,0.004808785393834114,0.02228361740708351,-0.0005832227179780602,-0.027654441073536873,0.039065517485141754,0.01950971782207489,0.04331763833761215,0.09203635901212692,0.039005208760499954,-0.005076201166957617,0.1022389680147171,-0.012908392585814,-0.008932164870202541,-0.08176543563604355,0.0016749013448134065,0.02412503957748413,0.027311138808727264,0.05588383600115776,-0.12945517897605896,1.2645090278802899e-33,0.05436421558260918,0.07789818942546844,0.06029669940471649,0.059873875230550766,0.011932659894227982,-0.07727330923080444,0.04208328574895859,-0.005589901469647884,-0.13015754520893097,0.07478349655866623,0.013759743422269821,-0.050139762461185455,-0.006663370877504349,0.04108385741710663,0.013394127599895,-0.05748158320784569,-0.03842610865831375,-0.008773121051490307,-0.012908300384879112,-0.09363217651844025,0.020845437422394753,0.011649915017187595,0.03371978923678398,0.025903785601258278,-0.04691358283162117,0.015792563557624817,0.0369810052216053,0.045738257467746735,-0.020993491634726524,-0.0029255948029458523,-0.03443612530827522,-0.029347535222768784,-0.06280520558357239,0.03767579421401024,0.043409351259469986,-0.020792018622159958,-0.016326045617461205,-0.14890091121196747,0.1323648989200592,0.013658718205988407,-0.03790607675909996,-0.02638401836156845,-0.037044133991003036,-0.1079162135720253,-0.024251533672213554,0.02530427649617195,-0.01693403534591198,0.00447335047647357,-0.0556311160326004,-0.005516686011105776,0.08163774758577347,-0.009640591219067574,0.043516866862773895,0.04385906830430031,-0.029351364821195602,0.0021742151584476233,-0.09568478167057037,0.008965618908405304,0.09028348326683044,0.07183148711919785,-0.07833557575941086,-0.0890369638800621,0.01905851811170578,0.08095218986272812,0.03945309296250343,-0.007259937468916178,-0.1112176924943924,0.02311413362622261,0.037998683750629425,0.08191557228565216,-0.005694577470421791,0.0014632628299295902,0.09832508116960526,-0.05616723746061325,0.04192265495657921,0.009495824575424194,0.07124070823192596,0.0366065539419651,-0.07496102154254913,0.07228417694568634,0.038353946059942245,0.08339222520589828,-0.10328268259763718,0.05109714716672897,-0.05522593483328819,-0.0933416411280632,-0.009806130081415176,-0.06732815504074097,-0.0694827288389206,-0.04805667698383331,0.01663440279662609,-0.04049742966890335,0.09574327617883682,0.01016591303050518,-0.0778767541050911,-2.515509421617724e-33,0.060241296887397766,-0.045040130615234375,0.12998950481414795,-0.058076053857803345,0.031197408214211464,-0.03179851919412613,0.04066021367907524,-0.028172200545668602,0.0018568361410871148,-0.030478501692414284,0.06703296303749084,0.04069961979985237,0.07969016581773758,0.006482089404016733,0.005677

{"title":"Essays on political and corporate governance","abstract":"In this dissertation, I investigate issues of governance and incentives in the firm and policy contexts.  In Chapter I, titled \"All on Board: Corporate Governance and Co-Determination\", I examine a model of corporate behavior under shared governance, also known as co-determination, in the form of employee-elected representatives on a firm's board of directors. Employee and shareholder representatives engage in sequential bargaining over the firm's labor, capital, production, and financing decisions. If the firm has market power and as long as employee representatives (e.g., a union) have an interest in increasing labor, a limited increase in employee representation on the board will result in an increase in labor and output, an ambiguous and small effect on capital expenditures, and a decrease in monopoly deadweight loss with no effect on wages, which is in line with previous empirical estimates of the effect of co-determination. In the presence of risk of costly default and tax advantages of debt, limited employee control can reduce socially inefficient reliance on debt over equity. However, if employees elect most or all of the board representatives, then the firm will instead choose to increase wages and may not be able to commit to repay equity, increasing the proportion of debt in its capital structure. In Chapter II, \"The Medici Vicious Circle\", I investigate the hypothesis that wealth and power accumulation can reinforce each other using a dynamic model of political economy in which a policymaker can redistribute wealth and affect the identity of future policymakers. I show that individual incentives for wealth accumulation can lead to the instability of \"democratic\" (i.e., median voter optimal) outcomes and generate high levels of wealth inequality even if it reduces welfare. I develop a novel probabilistic approach to the definition of power and the analysis of its accumulation: political power in the model is defined as the likelihood of one's optimal policy being implemented. The framework's flexibility allows me to compare a wide range of political institutions in terms of short and long run wealth and power inequality dynamics. In particular, the presence of democratic procedures can greatly reduce the accumulation of power and result in a more equal wealth distribution. To my knowledge this is the first paper to adopt such an approach to political power and I believe it can be used in future research to analyze concepts beyond wealth and inequality. I also show that the cost of power acquisition (i.e., the ability to influence future policy) can have a non-monotonic impact on welfare and inequality. A low cost of power acquisition results in high long run inequality as policymakers redistribute both wealth and power in favor of themselves. However, increasing the cost of power acquisition beyond a certain threshold can also lead to higher long run inequality, as it limits the persistence of all policies, including those that are socially optimal. In Chapter III, \"Down Round Avoidance in Venture Capital Contracts\", I study contracts between firms backed by venture capital and their investors, with a focus on the incentives determining the set of contractual provisions offered to investors. Although a substantial number of firms use similar contracts throughout their lifetime, some choose to give additional privileges to select investors. Using a dataset of 1783 rounds of financing of 313 firms, I show that avoidance of \"down rounds\", i.e., drops in issue price of newest shares relative to the issue price in a previous round, is a crucial factor in this decision, increasing the observed probability of a firm giving a new investor more rights by over 20%. Such behavior results in a transfer of wealth from existing investors to founders, in particular through the avoidance of strong anti-dilution provisions triggered by down rounds. Combined with anecdotal evidence suggesting that existing investors are typically involved in the raising of new funds, this result sheds light on the bargaining process between investors and

{"title":"Three essays on international trade and innovation","abstract":"This dissertation consists of three essays spanning the topics of international trade and innovation, with specific attention to their underlying legal institutions.   In the first chapter, I address the role of non-uniform trade policy in a world where firms are known to be heterogeneous. Since much firm-level policy occurs unilaterally and outside of negotiated most-favored nation tariff rates, exploring governments' strategic incentives in sequential-move environments is of interest. Compared to an existing heterogeneous-firm model with non-uniform tariffs, I add simplifying functional form assumptions that then allow me to add strategic behavior into the model. In particular, I allow one country to act as a Stackelberg leader in setting trade taxes, and I find that it always elects to impose a tax, and that the tax is larger than it would be if the follower were not expected to respond. I also discuss the specific policy avenues that are available to governments for levying non-uniform tariffs on firms and relate the situations in which these avenues may be used to forces and incentives in my model.   In the second chapter, joint with Lisa Ouellette, I turn to innovation policy and consider the market for vaccines. We review and synthesize research from a broad array of disciplines including economics, law, and public health, documenting the outsized benefits of vaccines juxtaposed with a seemingly anemic development pipeline. Vaccines have many attributes that are understood in the economic literature to limit the rents that a monopolist can extract. Most importantly, they are durable goods, and they are preventatives. Starting from this understanding, we argue that market-based innovation incentives, such as patents, will under-provide such goods relative to goods without these properties, even though the social benefit of such goods may be far greater.   In the third chapter, I consider international patenting flows and leverage the European Patent Office's DOCDB database, which contains detailed international patent bibliographic data, to consider patent application filings as a measure of knowledge diffusion and domestic knowledge production. After describing the international patenting regime and the incentives that drive it, I document a clear relationship between a country's market size and both its domestic knowledge production and its reception of foreign knowledge diffusion. I also find that, although bilateral patent flows resemble bilateral trade flows in that they increase with the size of the source and destination countries, distance does not play as clear a role in

{"title":"Understanding the microstructural and macroscopic evolution of dynamic polymer networks through coarse-grained molecular dynamics","abstract":"Due to their dynamic cross-linking bonds, highly stretchable and self-healable supramolecular elastomers are promising materials for future soft electronics, biomimetic systems, self-healing plastics, and smart textiles. The dynamic or reversible nature of the cross-links gives rise to interesting macroscopic responses in these materials such as self-healing and rapid stress-relaxation. Here, self-healing refers to the ability of the material to recover its shape and properties in its pristine state after it undergoes significant mechanical deformation such as extensive loading or material rupture. On the other hand, stress-relaxation refers to the relieving of stress in the elastomer when held indefinitely under deformation, a process that is accelerated due to the presence of dynamic cross-links. Though these properties of dynamic polymer networks are well documented, the relationship between bond activity and macroscopic mechanical response, and the self-healing properties of these dynamic polymer networks (DPNs) remains poorly understood. This dissertation aims to understand the dependence of the macroscopic responses of dynamic polymer networks on their microstructural evolution by using a two-pronged approach. The first is to identify a microstructural descriptor that can explain the macroscopic evolution of stress and the state of the material. The second is to identify the multiscale dynamic processes that precisely estimate the stress-relaxation response. For the first prong of our approach, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, we reveal a fundamental connection between the macroscopic behaviors of DPNs and the shortest paths between distant nodes in the polymer network. Notably, the trajectories of the material on the shortest path-strain map provide key insights into understanding the stress-strain hysteresis, anisotropy, stress relaxation, and self-healing of DPNs. Based on CGMD simulations under various loading histories, we formulate a set of empirical rules that dictate how the shortest path interacts with stress and strain. This lays the foundation for developing a physics-based theory centered around the non-local microstructural feature of shortest paths to predict the mechanical behavior of DPNs. However, these statistics can be costly to compute and difficult to study theoretically. To this end, we introduce a branching random walk (BRW) model to describe the SP statistics from the CGMD model of polymer networks. We postulate that the first passage time (FPT) of the BRW to a given termination site can be used to approximate the statistics of the SP between distant nodes in the polymer network. We develop a theoretical framework for studying the FPT of spatial branching processes and obtain an analytical expression for estimating the FPT distribution as a function of the cross-link density. We demonstrate by extensive numerical calculations that the distribution of the FPT of the BRW model agrees well with the SP distribution from the CGMD simulations. The theoretical estimate and the corresponding numerical implementations of BRW provide an efficient way of approximating the SP distribution in a polymer network. Our results have the physical meaning that by accounting for the realistic topology of polymer networks, extensive bond-breaking is expected to occur at a much smaller stretch than that expected from idealized models assuming periodic network structures. Our work presents the first analysis of polymer networks as a BRW and sets the framework for developing a generalizable spatial branching model for studying the macroscopic evolution of polymeric systems. This analysis identifies the SP between distant cross-links as a key microstructural parameter that governs material evolution and presents a theoretically tractable framework within which the SP evolution estimates can be made. The second prong of our approach is aimed at reconstructing or predicting the exact nature of the stress-relaxation behavior of the DPNs. The stress relaxation response obtained experimentally or from our CGMD simulations exhibits similar stretched exponential or non-exponential decay, which implies the contribution of multiple dynamic processes occurring at different time scales. We first probe the bond-breaking rates by using the transition state theory under different cross-link densities and polymer melt configurations. However, this limits us to the time scale and the length scale associated with a single cross-link. To access the dynamics at different length scales and time scales we computationally model a powerful experimental dynamics characterization technique called X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS). Interpretation of the XPCS data regarding underlying physical processes is necessary to establish the connection between the macroscopic responses and the microstructural dynamics. To aid the interpretation of the XPCS data, we present a computational framework to model these experiments by computing the X-ray scattering intensity directly from the atomic positions obtained from CGMD simulations. The time scale of the dynamics accessed by XPCS is controlled by the sampling frequency of the CGMD configurations whereas the size of the CGMD simulation cell controls the extent of the length scales accessed. By repeating the XPCS analysis at different sampling frequencies we can obtain the multiscale dynamics of the DPN simulated by the CGMD method. We found that the distribution of rates revealed by computational XPCS is consistent with the stretched exponential decay of the stress-relaxation response of the system. This dissertation presents a thorough analysis of the SP between distant cross-links as a microstructural descriptor that governs the macroscopically observed mechanical evolution (self-healing and rapid stress relaxation) of the DPN system. In addition, the XPCS analysis of the CGMD simulation trajectory is successful in uncovering the characteristic rates of the dynamic processes that accurately predict the rapid stress-relaxation exhibited by the DPNs. The methods presented in this dissertation to study the microstructural and dynamic evolution are applicable to a large class of elastomeric systems and can aid in the design of the next generation of

{"title":"Dry well performance analysis : efficiency of stormwater capture and emerging contaminant removal","abstract":"Dry wells are vadose zone infiltration wells that are deeper than their widest surface dimension. Dry wells are promising for urban stormwater capture and recharge because of their high infiltration capacity, low cost, and small footprint. However, little is known about how much stormwater can be captured by dry wells. Furthermore, since dry wells bypass the natural contaminant attenuation processes in topsoil, concerns have been raised about potential groundwater contamination by dry wells especially for hydrophilic organic compounds.   This study applies field monitoring, mathematical modeling, and laboratory testing to address the abovementioned concerns about dry wells. In the first part of the study, a hydrologic model was constructed using Storm Water Management Model to estimate the stormwater capture efficiency of dry wells under various climate conditions and evaluate different dry well deployment strategies. In the second part of the study, four pilot-scale stormwater treatment systems [i.e., biochar-amended filters, regenerated activated carbon (RAC)-amended filters, UV/H2O2 + biochar-amended filters, UV/H2O2 + RAC-amended filters] were developed and their performance for removal of hydrophilic contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) was tested under high flow rates and continuous CEC dosing. The field lifespan of the developed systems was estimated for a demonstration case study in a Los Angeles neighborhood using a contaminant transport model. Results from this work show that dry wells can be configured to capture about 20% of annual rainfall in Southern California. However, this efficiency will decrease because of climate change and thus better deployment strategies need to be employed. UV light coupled with black carbon-amended filters are cost-effective stormwater treatment systems for the removal of hydrophilic CECs in dry wells. Adopting these systems in dry wells can effectively increase public acceptance for stormwater capture and facilitate future deployment of dry wells.","vector":[0.04335566610097885,-0.018691394478082657,0.10636964440345764,-0.022030098363757133,0.05256534740328789,-0.04755114018917084,-0.028479626402258873,0.018409838899970055,0.003587157465517521,0.0009043838945217431,-0.065280482172966,-0.04894346743822098,0.02319423481822014,-0.025565991178154945,-0.029529297724366188,0.058202341198921204,0.003135035280138254,0.009694648906588554,-0.0264471136033535,0.04080227017402649,0.06055418401956558,0.010962020605802536,-0.09296049177646637,-0.014223742298781872,-0.010114283300936222,0.03556879609823227,-0.06191444769501686,0.04622504860162735,-0.06541174650192261,-0.03510689735412598,0.027114832773804665,0.022744979709386826,-0.029414895921945572,-0.05544814467430115,-0.007497457787394524,0.09475471824407578,-0.07878577709197998,0.016055801883339882,-0.0035847420804202557,0.0644158124923706,-0.009690914303064346,-0.06879138201475143,0.04629048332571983,-0.05059249699115753,0.031530242413282394,0.011315194889903069,-0.09372308850288391,-0.017266564071178436,0.0012502758763730526,-0.05577594041824341,0.04168633371591568,0.07950128614902496,-0.0507470928132534,0.04008530452847481,-0.0846308097243309,0.005774183664470911,-0.04948551952838898,-0.11076623201370239,-0.05715978518128395,-0.04611632972955704,-0.00812659040093422,0.017377495765686035,-0.07207418233156204,-0.004224071744829416,-0.03623242676258087,-0.034436218440532684,-0.08220615237951279,0.022692624479532242,0.06914035230875015,-0.07500915229320526,-0.12221762537956238,0.05712346360087395,0.04988797754049301,-0.03992002457380295,-0.059589631855487823,0.00975204911082983,0.03311459720134735,0.06161237508058548,-0.000421825738158077,-0.0616840124130249,0.11053891479969025,0.0463041216135025,0.072081558406353,-0.04612094908952713,0.009820742532610893,0.07135075330734253,-0.01494903489947319,-0.018134567886590958,0.10780083388090134,0.0021319035440683365,0.03687692806124687,0.028747884556651115,0.004033222328871489,0.0389779694378376,0.04331701248884201,-0.00810962449759245,0.09309399873018265,-0.051565300673246384,0.03558562323451042,0.0247033704072237,0.03621778264641762,-0.009449221193790436,0.02094382420182228,-0.1336836814880371,0.06276588141918182,0.011970579624176025,0.09291939437389374,0.026969358325004578,0.07604244351387024,-0.045608989894390106,-0.03457464650273323,0.04084542766213417,0.08690714836120605,0.009896550327539444,0.09224018454551697,0.02169978804886341,0.029232878237962723,-0.029969796538352966,-0.08069103211164474,-0.06392326951026917,-0.060610391199588776,-0.041450999677181244,0.026662668213248253,-0.052040159702301025,0.048795461654663086,0.11476296931505203,0.09740757942199707,4.4505872834482495e-33,-0.012270607054233551,-0.005060768220573664,-0.06001808121800423,-0.020551985129714012,0.006770724430680275,-0.0066260383464396,0.03339599817991257,-0.014287946745753288,0.0016960938228294253,-0.04877292737364769,-0.04624486342072487,-0.048116251826286316,-0.0783911868929863,0.057556960731744766,-0.018292192369699478,0.043436482548713684,0.026879901066422462,-0.012083029374480247,0.025758907198905945,-0.016915738582611084,-0.04336490482091904,-0.06797638535499573,-0.037418194115161896,0.0495331697165966,0.0616089329123497,-0.07155604660511017,0.06463641673326492,0.03782536834478378,-0.048054616898298264,-0.018870927393436432,0.09886670112609863,0.06646721810102463,0.013886853121221066,0.012526057660579681,0.012564095668494701,0.024157533422112465,-0.02427741512656212,0.04456694424152374,0.04344329982995987,-0.032784514129161835,-0.0061684041284024715,0.05668842792510986,-0.003976509440690279,-0.02031851001083851,0.004377777222543955,-0.08417679369449615,0.0030205457005649805,0.010511361993849277,0.00426679290831089,-0.07669505476951599,-0.0019205805147066712,0.019528798758983612,-0.06863913685083389,0.014096385799348354,-0.04859427735209465,0.021338172256946564,0.03599162399768829,-0.029346322640776634,0.0052420599386096,0.07512485235929489,-0.12846733629703522,0.07829061150550842,-0.0009941767202690244,-0.007229875773191452,0.08331244438886642,-0.04078619182109833,0.053592707961797714,0.10360540449619293,0.03852600231766701,-0.030750025063753128,-0.014836814254522324,-0.024393700063228607,-0.026025835424661636,0.08560100197792053,-0.03880225867033005,-0.06823699921369553,0.050057679414749146,-0.019624166190624237,0.02816162444651127,0.06562042981386185,0.023923972621560097,0.050403010100126266,-0.0015892749652266502,0.052518971264362335,-0.006071038078516722,0.009886919520795345,0.06084812805056572,-0.03183862194418907,0.007675880566239357,-0.04230419918894768,0.05534013733267784,0.009758616797626019,0.007020753342658281,-0.11841730773448944,0.04168722406029701,-3.603579318833481e-33,0.06213432922959328,0.002684683771803975,-0.08998426795005798,0.036011356860399246,0.0713050588965416,-0.08355270326137543,0.055683545768260956,0.0013018168974667788,0.04948744550347328,-0.014532599598169327,-0.010959895327687263,0.08596054464578629,-0.02225695736706257,-0.04563276842236519,0.03891

{"title":"Correspondence detection in natural terrain : computer vision techniques for noisy 3D range data","abstract":"Exploration of small bodies such as asteroids and comets can provide valuable scientific understanding of the history and evolution of our solar system, and a key component in these missions is generating a shape model of the target body. LiDAR systems are an emerging option for small body mapping, but face challenges with the point cloud correspondence detection step of the pipeline. Correlation-based correspondence detection techniques require a good initial alignment in order to reliably converge to an accurate result, and the high uncertainty of small bodies' motion models, coupled with the lack of external navigational infrastructure such as GNSS or fixed beacons makes this a challenging problem. With varying range sensor resolutions, high noise levels, and low-gradient terrain, the signal to noise level of the point cloud can cause feature-based techniques to have a low feature recall and a high ratio of outliers. When the overall number of features is small, which can be common in natural terrain applications and as is expected near safe rover landing sites, state of the art feature-based correspondence methods can unknowingly generate misaligned results.  In this thesis, a novel point cloud correspondence detection algorithm is presented that combines constellations of a small number of features within point cloud data with Iterative Closest Point (ICP) alignment solutions. First, a new handcrafted 3D point cloud descriptor, Smooth Signature of Histograms of OrienTations (SmoothSHOT), is tailored to natural terrain. Next, the Pyramid star tracker constellation detection algorithm is fused with the MinBucket graph matching algorithm to provide an efficient database search procedure, Pyramid Edge-Reduction Schema for Efficient Isomorphism Detection (PERSEID). Constellations of features are combined into metafeatures in order to identify the most distinctive constellation matches within the dataset and prevent susceptibility to repetitive or ambiguous geometry. Finally, ICP is initialized with the metafeature alignment, and then the result is validated by it as well. When applied to a model of the asteroid Itokawa with realistic noise and resolution changes, ICP alone achieves a precision of only 60-70% across a range of noise conditions and resolution changes. RANdom SAmple and Consensus (RANSAC) initialized ICP has 99% precision at low noise settings, but only 44% at the realistic noise conditions. The algorithm presented in this thesis, PERSEID-Augmented ICP (PAI), is able to achieve a correspondence detection precision of 100% under the same conditions. On an underwater sonar dataset where ICP and RANSAC-initialized ICP have 53% and 32% precision, respectively, the PAI algorithm is able to achieve 90% precision.

{"title":"Improving access to untranscribed speech corpora using AI","abstract":"How easily speech corpora can be indexed and searched has a direct impact on how effectively its contents can be used by many interested parties — from linguists, to language teachers, to community members. As transcribing speech is much more time consuming than recording it, large parts of speech corpora typically remain untranscribed, making it difficult to index and search these sub-parts. While searchable transcriptions can be automatically derived using a speech-to-text system for major languages like English, such technologies are typically unavailable for smaller languages, especially those typical in language documentation work. For documentation projects, this difficulty creates a bottleneck for creating language learning materials for language revitalisation and maintenance as well as linguistic analyses. In this dissertation, I propose four approaches to widen this bottleneck to enable some form of search or indexing, or accelerate the time-consuming process of transcription. Each chapter addresses a common but distinct scenario within language documentation projects according to the types and amounts of available data. For each scenario, I propose a context-appropriate, data-efficient solution that leverages AI speech models as well as external resources where appropriate.","vector":[-0.07945706695318222,-0.03065962716937065,0.028257466852664948,-0.005009801592677832,0.0587533563375473,0.04674713313579559,0.01553176250308752,0.0013875830918550491,0.012726466171443462,-0.021452832967042923,-0.04855406656861305,-0.028565922752022743,-0.02393273264169693,0.05163614824414253,-0.013202020898461342,0.02843194268643856,0.031418077647686005,0.10076562315225601,-0.01955288276076317,-0.06443644315004349,0.07749379426240921,0.1371643841266632,0.03358907252550125,-0.010139627382159233,0.0423102080821991,0.015001500956714153,-0.036651886999607086,-0.14447765052318573,0.031951576471328735,0.01585952751338482,-0.05346865579485893,0.043222635984420776,0.05456283316016197,0.09064985066652298,-0.01598493754863739,0.01309968251734972,0.014029398560523987,0.04173601418733597,0.030970968306064606,-0.026546264067292213,-0.07013674825429916,-0.006684016901999712,-0.03439214080572128,-0.012397120706737041,0.06266883760690689,0.004590790718793869,-0.02288314327597618,-0.005461371038109064,0.044547487050294876,0.03735663741827011,-0.15235984325408936,-0.031119370833039284,0.03743942454457283,0.05430081859230995,-0.023365147411823273,-0.020639579743146896,0.044097334146499634,0.013172276318073273,0.006636152043938637,-0.04543571174144745,-0.032982200384140015,-0.04618718475103378,-0.015287283807992935,-0.024926654994487762,-0.01772216707468033,-0.059419985860586166,0.03805570676922798,0.059308458119630814,0.023758333176374435,0.05839812755584717,-0.05913030728697777,0.12382733076810837,-0.0187661312520504,0.0534452348947525,-0.021758684888482094,0.0482759103178978,-0.017550654709339142,-0.039120644330978394,0.05995099991559982,-0.08729331940412521,0.04153740778565407,0.0027857066597789526,0.09867402911186218,-0.0008444773266091943,-0.021951992064714432,-0.0520157590508461,0.06887409090995789,-0.04149052873253822,0.04582449421286583,0.0022212497424334288,-0.03740512952208519,-0.07076029479503632,0.1039223000407219,-0.08034127950668335,0.057469677180051804,0.08266549557447433,0.019163863733410835,-0.038832493126392365,0.07327022403478622,0.028217043727636337,-0.02297111228108406,0.04738355055451393,0.012198258191347122,-0.11912978440523148,-0.1546006053686142,-0.001993021694943309,-0.0021415301598608494,-0.03535361588001251,0.044854190200567245,-0.02281235158443451,0.0014763622311875224,0.041311293840408325,-0.03768998384475708,-0.05375527963042259,0.06976275891065598,-0.02222069352865219,0.03363775461912155,-0.03487205505371094,0.007010112516582012,0.1095886081457138,-0.07618282735347748,0.07323706150054932,0.017738452181220055,0.0316108837723732,-0.011727876961231232,7.466434908565134e-05,-0.046194735914468765,1.5389698773950086e-33,0.1305789202451706,0.08834425359964371,-0.044758740812540054,0.04555276036262512,-0.02204960584640503,-0.0695151835680008,0.06509114056825638,0.04960140958428383,-0.06373434513807297,-0.04452700540423393,0.006522387266159058,0.05693366378545761,-0.05224420875310898,0.031658634543418884,0.0034849585499614477,-0.00095037289429456,0.0027840393595397472,0.05540720745921135,0.00253502675332129,-0.003221602877601981,0.03953394293785095,-0.003126544877886772,0.06861962378025055,-0.015426065772771835,0.05262055993080139,-0.034815866500139236,0.043783992528915405,-0.12273415178060532,0.03057989478111267,0.0038982185069471598,-0.04461069405078888,-0.07660899311304092,0.012682292610406876,-0.026943042874336243,0.046462059020996094,-0.052936289459466934,-0.022859420627355576,-0.0165532398968935,0.006863375194370747,-0.01902298629283905,-0.043863698840141296,-0.008431262336671352,0.044513218104839325,-0.024105848744511604,-0.02431643195450306,-0.009350787848234177,-0.04402448236942291,-0.0033928442280739546,0.05990580841898918,-0.03563384339213371,0.0578773058950901,0.06285831332206726,-0.056264229118824005,0.0034283592831343412,0.06469739973545074,0.04705275967717171,0.014313801191747189,-0.013571196235716343,0.02336118556559086,-0.009157192893326283,0.016877328976988792,0.01470310427248478,0.03952779248356819,0.03586734086275101,0.011416319757699966,0.02146322652697563,-0.02775869145989418,0.05061491206288338,0.09340901672840118,-0.0614258237183094,-0.006554173305630684,-0.07967328280210495,0.03828681632876396,-0.052998993545770645,0.03161826729774475,0.03549228236079216,-0.009111573919653893,-0.08906636387109756,-0.02107650227844715,-0.014948894269764423,-0.0335477739572525,-0.06729675084352493,0.043417464941740036,-0.03802206367254257,0.050510432571172714,-0.10582142323255539,-0.017817631363868713,-0.09380213171243668,0.012847676873207092,-0.00660563912242651,-0.027151741087436676,0.02415139600634575,-0.13133588433265686,-0.005293332040309906,0.0018731501186266541,-2.658390759960173e-33,0.002350154332816601,-0.055452510714530945,0.014776135794818401,0.049429893493652344,-0.06183649227023125,-0.012163853272795677,0.00798984058201313,-0.018919117748737335,0.037091583013534546,-0.03808746486902237,-0.10305371135473251,-0.08388155698776245,0.08839071542024612,-0.02444443106

{"title":"Systems and synthetic biology approaches enable first-principles models of transcription in human cells","abstract":"The binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to genomic enhancers activates gene expression in mammalian cells. However, the molecular details that link enhancer sequence to TF binding, promoter state, and gene expression levels remain opaque. We applied single-molecule footprinting (SMF) to measure the simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes, and components of the transcription machinery on engineered enhancer/promoter constructs with variable numbers of TF binding sites for both a synthetic and an endogenous TF. We find that activation domains enhance a TF's capacity to compete with nucleosomes for binding to DNA in a BAF-dependent manner, TF binding on nucleosome-free DNA is consistent with independent binding between TFs, and average TF occupancy linearly contributes to promoter activation rates. We also decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms, which can be tuned and perturbed independently. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the binding microstates observed at the enhancer and subsequent time-dependent gene expression. Chapters 2-4 provide a template for quantitative dissection of distinct contributors to gene activation, including the activity of chromatin remodelers, TF activation domains, chromatin acetylation, TF concentration, TF binding affinity, and TF binding site configuration. Chapter 5 demonstrates how novel large serine recombinases can facilitate highly controlled and fast parallel DNA reporter assays by integrating linear DNA library members into landing pads. Chapter 6 characterizes how transcriptional run-on between two tandem genes can lead to unexpected gene expression dynamics in synthetic gene systems. Taken together, this thesis provides novel biological insights and tools to advance understanding and engineering of gene expression in human cells.","vector":[-0.01657198742032051,-0.13519208133220673,-0.055306077003479004,-0.014991920441389084,0.05643676221370697,-0.020124003291130066,-0.034172605723142624,0.021592071279883385,0.05236925557255745,-0.02171916887164116,-0.009114117361605167,-0.016167661175131798,-0.03888222575187683,0.05653694272041321,0.0454828217625618,0.09161412715911865,-0.06278479099273682,0.07086507976055145,-0.044513460248708725,-0.10863705724477768,0.04234356805682182,0.04883769899606705,0.09156690537929535,-0.004089124500751495,0.02159702591598034,-0.07304150611162186,-0.011222614906728268,0.01339402049779892,0.011700665578246117,0.0036905419547110796,-0.023340141400694847,0.03407706320285797,0.04559326171875,-0.09192610532045364,0.03024839423596859,-0.02348770759999752,-0.026974938809871674,0.04705248773097992,-0.030045803636312485,-0.02436666749417782,0.08291885256767273,-0.02508232556283474,-0.008263790979981422,0.08381249010562897,-0.062072522938251495,-0.0379205122590065,0.06782659143209457,0.02888842485845089,-0.04298197478055954,0.01348068192601204,0.04596904665231705,0.030585110187530518,-0.06438075751066208,-0.059102922677993774,-0.007119324989616871,0.06540213525295258,-0.03651506081223488,-0.0535602942109108,0.011636108160018921,-0.06542046368122101,0.005602686665952206,-0.05303880572319031,0.037741560488939285,0.01779654435813427,0.11849963665008545,-0.0496707484126091,0.04630236327648163,0.04389900714159012,-0.10698948800563812,0.038632962852716446,-0.07681076228618622,-0.07160372287034988,-0.026175709441304207,0.0006760352989658713,0.0035220456775277853,0.08154482394456863,0.05487581342458725,0.06404607743024826,0.04230623319745064,-0.020710960030555725,-0.03043753281235695,-0.00022231173352338374,0.10004188865423203,-0.025425082072615623,0.007921230047941208,-0.001464460277929902,0.01728575862944126,0.10252358019351959,0.09086792916059494,0.09498697519302368,-0.0035082774702459574,-0.07139349728822708,0.024550197646021843,0.001481744460761547,-0.01878456026315689,0.016587283462285995,-0.025342026725411415,-0.0120010981336236,-0.02778135985136032,-0.06173626333475113,-0.030973119661211967,-0.008253009989857674,-0.05010639503598213,0.05045470967888832,0.006841942202299833,0.03352799266576767,0.024898454546928406,0.029887275770306587,0.012297064065933228,0.09351517260074615,0.03613237291574478,0.03112199902534485,0.06797108799219131,0.0820470079779625,-0.02861165814101696,0.021506989374756813,-0.029120927676558495,0.015290526673197746,0.08507994562387466,-0.033568281680345535,-0.05632123351097107,0.009052502922713757,-0.011674500070512295,0.01953008398413658,-0.09011472016572952,0.0058250948786735535,-0.08466830849647522,2.5517570756222753e-33,0.019906608387827873,0.06787722557783127,0.016424383968114853,0.08923047035932541,-0.009909939020872116,-0.02756679616868496,-0.0019450688268989325,-0.0172846969217062,-0.17603708803653717,0.06137455627322197,-0.0011058372911065817,0.018745170906186104,0.043628863990306854,0.10785631835460663,-0.0737764984369278,-0.032204266637563705,0.018367072567343712,0.0715923085808754,-0.012830425053834915,-0.024820199236273766,-0.0575140044093132,0.06299927830696106,-0.06857559084892273,0.010183922946453094,0.09534357488155365,-0.03718135133385658,-0.05185680463910103,0.03332837298512459,-0.0576297789812088,-0.01008294615894556,-0.07339759916067123,0.007748918607831001,0.006871580146253109,-0.009300226345658302,0.09894712269306183,-0.050268374383449554,0.039315372705459595,-0.009778568521142006,-0.029085272923111916,0.017651386559009552,0.0009678961359895766,-0.008619270287454128,0.019972752779722214,-0.06363768875598907,-0.0796533152461052,-0.01898331195116043,-0.009197776205837727,-0.03298994153738022,-0.07104821503162384,0.00484947906807065,-0.052910272032022476,0.02356330305337906,0.06442602723836899,-0.05522890016436577,-0.09801853448152542,-0.011623180471360683,-0.0796942487359047,-0.04887216538190842,0.0287501011043787,0.007583198603242636,-0.157170832157135,-0.04020632430911064,-0.002312019933015108,0.03515000268816948,0.06784094125032425,0.009888753294944763,-0.07137882709503174,-0.01884305477142334,0.020845022052526474,0.09618689864873886,0.05616987869143486,0.037260767072439194,0.08775468915700912,-0.08272603154182434,-0.014552459120750427,-0.01950228214263916,-0.0479557178914547,-0.010288714431226254,-0.057546086609363556,0.09832748770713806,-0.034271374344825745,-0.010921786539256573,-0.035041600465774536,-0.030524447560310364,-0.01639239490032196,-0.10406748205423355,-0.04606219753623009,-0.014488957822322845,-0.01981380209326744,-0.04258362203836441,0.03490690514445305,-0.05636853352189064,0.04606471583247185,-0.07468296587467194,-0.009419062174856663,-5.3214350081816635e-33,0.06516395509243011,0.03247721120715141,0.04493477940559387,0.018352527171373367,-0.02800329029560089,-0.00124101503752172,0.0021069867070764303,-0.049088019877672195,-0.003533128881826997,-0.11411676555871964,0.016727149486541748,-0.013756985776126385,-0.016660017892718315,-0.04565748944878578,

{"title":"Progress towards cavity-based X-ray free-electron lasers : demonstration of cavity ringdown and microbunch rotation out-coupling","abstract":"Current X-ray Free-Electron Lasers (XFELs), including the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC, are single-pass SASE (self-amplified spontaneous emission) machines, where electrons produce X-rays as they pass through an undulator line just once.  The exponential gain of X-ray power in an XFEL occurs as X-rays act on the electron beam, causing it to form microbunches at the X-ray wavelength.  In a SASE XFEL, the X-rays which initiate this process come from noise in the beam, and thus X-rays produced by current XFELs are transversely coherent, but longitudinally noisy.  In proposed cavity-based XFELs (CBXFELs), by contrast, X-rays are spectrally filtered and returned by mirrors from the end of the undulator line to the beginning, so a strong X-ray pulse is used to seed the FEL process on subsequent passes.  Future X-ray light sources based on CBXFELs can thus improve longitudinal coherence and spectral brightness, and promise to be more stable than current XFELs.  In this thesis I discuss the requirements to build a CBXFEL cavity and several aspects of CBXFEL development.  I cover in detail the characterization of CBXFEL-quality diamond mirrors, two cavity out-coupling methods including active cavity Q-switching and microbunch rotation, and a demonstration of a 14 m

{"title":"Using foundation models to learn how to represent electronic health records","abstract":"The invention and use of electronic health records has enabled new applications of machine learning in the field of healthcare. One particularly important application is the use of machine learning to predict the risk of a variety of clinical outcomes given electronic health records. However, training machine learning models on electronic health records is often challenging due to limited data set sizes and the intrinsic complexity of electronic health record data. In this dissertation, I propose and validate the use of foundation models as a way to learn representations for electronic health records, taking advantage of the longitudinal structure of medical record data to learn transferable representations. These representations can then be used to improve our ability to predict patient risk, achieving superior ranking performance, increased robustness across both time and space, and better label efficiency.","vector":[-0.030786212533712387,-0.02859131060540676,-0.003504296764731407,-0.026158055290579796,0.07628276944160461,0.07112924754619598,-0.022010251879692078,0.029956383630633354,0.03158432990312576,-0.08315638452768326,-0.043463025242090225,0.035945795476436615,0.050936535000801086,-0.007218728307634592,-0.0448562316596508,-0.06654518097639084,-0.037737421691417694,-0.012950473465025425,-0.05230466648936272,-0.0030924417078495026,-0.018172988668084145,0.08420200645923615,0.03481622412800789,0.06611878424882889,-0.02380307763814926,-0.014602352865040302,-6.0452155594248325e-05,0.011248831637203693,-0.010096429847180843,-0.028607018291950226,0.04899962246417999,-0.0316653698682785,-0.016500407829880714,-0.00880594365298748,-0.06540433317422867,-0.03062344901263714,-0.043291687965393066,0.08566761016845703,-0.05974989011883736,-0.03783493489027023,-0.0072168027982115746,-0.05049530789256096,0.028732333332300186,0.09153316169977188,0.08029375225305557,0.08134645223617554,-0.04030318185687065,-0.07678017020225525,0.004889192525297403,0.07120059430599213,-0.08587907999753952,-0.028506392613053322,-0.008460437878966331,0.10745479166507721,-0.05575861409306526,-0.014308737590909004,-0.018967369571328163,-0.07783351093530655,-0.13975797593593597,0.01032822672277689,-0.016421766951680183,-0.08847258239984512,0.012958118692040443,-0.0011096183443441987,-0.031887903809547424,-9.021896403282881e-05,0.0009216177277266979,0.07427871972322464,-0.05616948753595352,-0.01692374050617218,-0.09033528715372086,0.022145090624690056,-0.07671816647052765,0.1031033918261528,0.028687424957752228,0.015105209313333035,0.0012289060978218913,0.019359245896339417,0.036025408655405045,0.021236957982182503,-0.04379891976714134,0.03924303874373436,0.02146839164197445,0.04308483377099037,0.08175431191921234,-0.04355820640921593,0.06381772458553314,-0.013828465715050697,-0.09997250139713287,-0.06692646443843842,0.07829175889492035,0.04023641347885132,0.11254075914621353,0.013430062681436539,-0.05036722868680954,-0.022623825818300247,-0.03843121975660324,-0.05465398728847504,0.03013015352189541,0.05926312133669853,-0.09573037177324295,0.09897112101316452,0.05572269856929779,0.019379032775759697,0.036810893565416336,-0.075474314391613,-0.015464311465620995,0.005764308851212263,0.06227461248636246,-0.08061665296554565,0.0665469765663147,0.017877019941806793,-0.04795973375439644,-0.034531544893980026,0.014911931939423084,0.009271756745874882,-0.12433956563472748,-0.0700448751449585,-0.008133973926305771,0.05062749609351158,-0.014642014168202877,-0.02078489400446415,-0.053896673023700714,0.0389515645802021,-0.0799064040184021,-0.050573188811540604,-0.02593321166932583,1.2194469111189983e-33,0.0486639030277729,0.05903998017311096,0.05820541828870773,-0.026259204372763634,0.04815742373466492,-0.05882628634572029,-0.02281263843178749,0.006084235850721598,0.03339352086186409,-0.009002850390970707,-0.04629862681031227,0.03493514284491539,0.02818244695663452,0.04808346554636955,-0.020117538049817085,0.024734048172831535,-0.04744350165128708,0.06922312080860138,-0.030518261715769768,-0.004772255662828684,0.029883256182074547,-0.04954390227794647,0.0014502528356388211,-0.002827925141900778,0.017421115189790726,0.03080820105969906,-0.01683799922466278,0.07194782048463821,-0.0019120918586850166,-0.011748600751161575,-0.0377923920750618,-0.03449040651321411,0.01622270978987217,-0.04882561415433884,0.09316009283065796,0.0006656886544078588,0.011360581032931805,0.016502192243933678,0.09665205329656601,-0.05328749492764473,-0.012220838107168674,0.04209698736667633,0.07001501321792603,0.009034245274960995,-0.014870590530335903,-0.01103305071592331,0.025868047028779984,-0.04185767099261284,-0.02988971769809723,-0.03995301574468613,0.006155722308903933,-0.09346044808626175,-0.03887546807527542,-0.012979727238416672,-0.04504913464188576,0.07091344892978668,-0.041611481457948685,0.04086120054125786,-0.021994350478053093,0.0009888604981824756,0.0647445097565651,0.04644670709967613,0.039094604551792145,0.01399981789290905,-0.06079452112317085,0.014097168110311031,0.046559687703847885,-0.0881057009100914,0.07954570651054382,-0.021940656006336212,0.013877885416150093,0.08310262113809586,-0.012786823324859142,-0.08490411192178726,0.04116136580705643,-0.0282151997089386,-0.0010910843266174197,-0.07938273251056671,-0.03404175117611885,0.06467527896165848,-0.02257336489856243,0.008919480256736279,-0.04518984630703926,-0.016108205541968346,-0.006099511403590441,-0.06740576773881912,0.0274173803627491,-0.01973932795226574,-0.08910565823316574,0.004150873515754938,-0.11657806485891342,0.035761263221502304,0.06637343764305115,0.055529531091451645,0.00806739553809166,-2.4035211768408384e-33,-0.005987067706882954,0.025983549654483795,0.006602004170417786,-0.008535139262676239,0.04708732292056084,-0.006247475743293762,-0.015954041853547096,0.08203797042369843,-0.0015783535782247782,0.04100858047604561,0.041456952691078186,-0.020242877304553986,0.014819113537669182,-0

{"title":"Deep learning and CRISPR-Cas13D ortholog discovery for optimized RNA targeting","abstract":"Effective mammalian transcriptome engineering technologies are needed to accelerate biological discovery and RNA therapeutics. Despite the promise of programmable CRISPR-Cas13 ribonucleases, their utility has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of guide RNA design rules and computational models for prediction of high efficiency guides. Here, we quantified the performance of 127,000 RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNAs and systematically evaluated seven machine learning models to build a guide efficiency prediction algorithm.

{"title":"Tools for coronary MR angiography : non-cartesian trajectories and motion-corrected reconstructions","abstract":"X-ray coronary angiography remains the predominant technique for coronary artery examination, yet it exposes both patients and operators to ionizing radiation and is invasive. Despite strong demand for non-invasive and safer alternatives, the clinical adoption of coronary MR angiography has been slow.  The primary challenges in coronary MR angiography are its prolonged scan time and limited resolution. Because coronary arteries often follow tortuous paths and have relatively small diameters, high resolving power is required. Additionally, whole-heart imaging is preferred over target-volume methods, as it reduces operator dependency. Achieving large volumetric coverage at high resolution demands collecting a significant amount of data. However, continuous myocardial movement restricts data collection to specific cardiac cycles, necessitating the segmented data acquisition over multiple heartbeats. Consequently, coronary MR angiography is slow and susceptible to both respiratory and cardiac motion.  This dissertation introduces several tools for coronary MR angiography categorized into non-Cartesian trajectory design and non-rigid motion-corrected reconstruction. Non-Cartesian trajectories often exhibit higher sampling efficiency and greater robustness against undersampling compared to traditional rectilinear approaches, making them particularly useful for reducing the overall scan duration. Because non-rigid models capture a wide range of transformations, non-rigid motion-corrected reconstruction reduces resolution loss due to respiratory and cardiac motion.","vector":[0.042167991399765015,-0.016446217894554138,0.014844710938632488,-0.004603355657309294,0.022591007873415947,-0.08144859969615936,-0.04141482710838318,-0.005756443832069635,0.04960397258400917,-0.05198461189866066,-0.02613343670964241,0.03879339620471001,0.006273818202316761,0.06892005354166031,-0.056383319199085236,-0.06602761894464493,0.006911065895110369,0.04416166990995407,0.05168340727686882,0.09867317974567413,-0.011349058710038662,0.02876182645559311,-0.054191604256629944,-0.03436272591352463,0.025218745693564415,0.051100775599479675,-0.01062301266938448,-0.13562491536140442,0.0008586806943640113,-0.014391385950148106,0.03804238140583038,0.0015826732851564884,-0.029290320351719856,-0.013553308323025703,-0.041455645114183426,-0.013792943209409714,0.033185578882694244,0.07312410324811935,-0.0656592845916748,0.036681365221738815,0.0400247760117054,0.021885208785533905,0.025085769593715668,-0.051840245723724365,0.08989798277616501,0.050433672964572906,0.010460657998919487,-0.04038313031196594,0.03855181485414505,0.11275225132703781,-0.09093310683965683,-0.05118296295404434,-0.11011399328708649,0.028603583574295044,-0.006023112218827009,0.04466531053185463,-0.019520608708262444,-0.07020597904920578,0.05910908803343773,-0.06593223661184311,0.04208327457308769,-0.011064720340073109,0.003041531192138791,0.031829748302698135,-0.1388174146413803,-0.06590314954519272,0.004721210803836584,0.025667820125818253,0.07005442678928375,0.09756387025117874,0.004381449427455664,0.029245533049106598,0.03513937070965767,-0.00488312030211091,-0.06910409033298492,-0.032931964844465256,0.02277257665991783,-0.023215103894472122,0.02533693239092827,-0.012848750688135624,0.008458657190203667,-0.004689844325184822,-0.052199266850948334,-0.011578485369682312,0.027255577966570854,0.06314636766910553,0.019792303442955017,0.031787123531103134,0.029865536838769913,-0.004881605040282011,0.03203050419688225,0.0958268940448761,-0.04105091094970703,0.007802184671163559,0.017570652067661285,-0.03344587981700897,0.05839338153600693,0.033359721302986145,0.03664981946349144,0.048489876091480255,0.09630216658115387,0.008497070521116257,-0.04147394374012947,0.08151973783969879,-0.03110649809241295,-0.1176142618060112,0.019385414198040962,-0.03042623959481716,-0.015550192445516586,0.03442305326461792,0.05438198149204254,-0.004739197436720133,0.016858486458659172,-0.012800290249288082,0.11253610253334045,-0.014973473735153675,-0.046043191105127335,0.02040943317115307,-0.023515235632658005,0.0712820366024971,-0.010479003190994263,-0.12198306620121002,-0.016589075326919556,-0.0008281198097392917,0.0826958641409874,-0.007253505289554596,-0.024753615260124207,3.811364108388644e-33,-0.030176857486367226,0.07231592386960983,0.09006360173225403,0.015846839174628258,0.0009989752434194088,-0.03818410262465477,-0.030885230749845505,-0.01818971522152424,0.05779965594410896,0.08081398159265518,0.009133147075772285,0.02268148958683014,-0.0013549027498811483,0.016489701345562935,-0.01966685988008976,-0.06444454938173294,0.021796846762299538,0.109496109187603,-0.07928392291069031,0.032112181186676025,0.026604028418660164,-0.07164444774389267,-0.04220626503229141,-0.04635671153664589,-0.05483081191778183,0.037728916853666306,0.03767966851592064,-0.04527909308671951,0.014259818941354752,0.008610839955508709,-0.09278383105993271,-0.06986767053604126,0.02603038400411606,0.04039581120014191,-0.003817265387624502,-0.020916704088449478,-0.03887971490621567,-0.06848761439323425,-0.007520232815295458,0.0935896560549736,0.012607625685632229,0.07107580453157425,-0.01705484464764595,-0.016034377738833427,0.019506867974996567,-0.005016201175749302,0.01530930120497942,0.0879599079489708,-0.06648043543100357,-0.008638754487037659,-0.04574313759803772,-0.022947613149881363,0.018130702897906303,-0.02283761464059353,-0.0051962025463581085,-0.06285279989242554,-0.02974468655884266,0.04903890937566757,-0.06334027647972107,0.03890688344836235,-0.031052805483341217,-0.045245785266160965,-0.019333722069859505,0.058781757950782776,-0.07798083126544952,-0.004507202655076981,-0.06469119340181351,-0.008835263550281525,0.040145620703697205,0.08392873406410217,-0.022890843451023102,0.04110981896519661,0.01444592047482729,-0.09421516209840775,0.07159468531608582,0.0230865441262722,-0.0019701041746884584,0.18607529997825623,-0.011667029932141304,-0.07029259204864502,-0.05809089541435242,0.03137344866991043,-0.020388614386320114,-0.023983482271432877,0.011990510858595371,-0.019311020150780678,0.04508836194872856,0.030523115769028664,-0.035625260323286057,-0.02196158654987812,-0.046854544430971146,0.061478957533836365,-0.03931482136249542,-0.030485881492495537,0.024683814495801926,-1.8427152299245876e-33,0.03241226449608803,-0.021177511662244797,0.059191007167100906,-0.008490911684930325,-0.01389762107282877,0.019868064671754837,0.041853923350572586,-0.025279201567173004,0.09463623911142349,-0.1522233486175537,-0.06410550326108932,-0.04525397717952728,-0.013938289135694504,-0.

{"title":"Stabilized discretizations for fluid flows and coupled poromechanics","abstract":"In this thesis we develop various stabilized spatial discretizations for fluid flow problems and coupled poromechanics. We start by considering isogeometric collocation methods, which have arisen as an efficient alternative to Galerkin discretizations for high-order simulations of mechanics. We wish to apply theses schemes to incompressible flow problems, which requires the development of appropriate stabilization strategies. The classical SUPG method is extended to a collocation setting, which stabilizes spline collocation schemes in highly advective regimes. Simultaneously, we show that PSPG stabilization allows one to collocation mixed problems with an equal-order scheme. We show that these stabilizations are effective are removing instabilities while also retaining the inherent high-order accuracy of spline collocation methods when applied to the scalar advection, incompressible Stokes, and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.  Continuing the focus on isogeometric collocation methods, we move on to consider applications in compressible flows. Stabilization strategies are again needed, in this case so that the scheme can handle shocks. We extend a residual-based, artificial viscosity method for this purpose, and we develop a projection-inspired alternative to SUPG stabilization. Results on a variety of conservation laws show the robustness of the stabilized scheme, again without sacrificing accuracy on smooth problems.   We then turn away from isogeometric collocation methods and pure fluid flow problems. The latter half of the thesis considers coupled poromechanics, or the coupled problem of flow through a deformable porous media. We consider spatial discretization using a coupled finite element - finite volume approach using piecewise linear and piecewise constant representations for mechanics and flow, respectively. While commonly used in practice, this discretization choice will exhibit pressure instabilities as undrained conditions are approached due to a lack of inf-sup stability. We show that pressure jump stabilization is effective at removing spurious pressure oscillations that appear in the nearly undrained burden regions when simulating CO2 sequestration, and study numerical properties such as the proper selection of stabilization constants for different meshes.   Finally, we consider the performance of iteratively, or sequentially, coupled schemes for poromechanics when undrained regions are present. We clarify the relationship between fractional step schemes and the inf-sup condition, and in particular note that the fact that sequential schemes do not form or invert the full saddle-point matrix at any point is not enough to conclude that spurious pressure oscillations will not appear. However, pressure jump stabilization can be trivially extended to the fixed-stress method considered, and this both removes spurious pressure oscillations and improves the efficiency of the scheme.","vector":[-0.03706130385398865,-0.03182124346494675,0.050814539194107056,0.0008034339407458901,-0.02830698899924755,-0.03938330337405205,-0.03253358229994774,-0.05605541542172432,0.03478015214204788,-0.036672890186309814,-0.07101012021303177,0.12266355752944946,-0.04377618432044983,-0.011882183142006397,-0.08889615535736084,-0.026027023792266846,-0.03655972704291344,0.12785735726356506,-0.02680932730436325,0.026793574914336205,-0.0109447306022048,-0.012472419068217278,-0.09886804968118668,0.0124276801943779,0.07239539921283722,0.015298192389309406,0.010739760473370552,0.05735738202929497,-0.03043968975543976,0.04904370382428169,0.015827281400561333,-0.012017343193292618,-0.10516629368066788,-0.04746236279606819,-0.05962275341153145,-0.014256153255701065,0.014266139827668667,0.03256409615278244,-0.04491884261369705,0.03217574208974838,0.0008408167632296681,0.026346568018198013,0.08301396667957306,-0.08086875081062317,0.02946201153099537,-0.06420782953500748,-0.060647591948509216,-0.006336643360555172,-0.04772934690117836,-0.00206148368306458,-0.052079636603593826,-0.003494245931506157,0.010288192890584469,-0.021501215174794197,-0.04448319599032402,-0.012925944291055202,0.010914968326687813,-0.009062009863555431,0.04623030498623848,-0.058485981076955795,-0.004493218380957842,-0.021947115659713745,-0.01940072700381279,0.05595169588923454,-0.04299483448266983,-0.03227633237838745,0.13275671005249023,0.06348782777786255,0.02190004289150238,0.1415264755487442,-0.03810570389032364,0.0586942620575428,-0.035332586616277695,0.035155877470970154,0.027127206325531006,0.039757467806339264,-0.023062648251652718,0.02304067276418209,-0.033348921686410904,-0.006298097316175699,0.10773447155952454,0.07093293964862823,-0.02662177011370659,-0.06875631213188171,-0.07506627589464188,-0.026086434721946716,-0.07067668437957764,-0.02356376312673092,0.07170555740594864,-0.00787295587360859,0.027346715331077576,0.07502800971269608,-0.021247074007987976,0.01504048053175211,-0.005047619808465242,0.029066072776913643,0.0052588703110814095,0.022164924070239067,0.048003900796175,0.03710010647773743,-0.036985039710998535,-0.026107436046004295,0.031028782948851585,0.04072655364871025,0.10038015991449356,-0.01328031811863184,0.05667783319950104,-0.0351947583258152,-0.008162948302924633,0.027075575664639473,-0.007799762766808271,-0.05030656233429909,0.025632746517658234,0.0578211173415184,0.01683937758207321,-0.04515651613473892,0.017370330169796944,0.011563263833522797,0.11340200155973434,-0.10030245780944824,0.013055941089987755,-0.001900271512567997,0.010214639827609062,0.014543878845870495,0.04620640352368355,0.03670079633593559,0.006725807208567858,8.476217012355926e-34,0.01694396510720253,0.04862019419670105,0.1234336867928505,0.10787040740251541,-0.02565574273467064,-0.04670649394392967,0.02151069976389408,-0.019709624350070953,-0.06544067710638046,0.09270504117012024,-0.03815307468175888,0.04838996380567551,-0.04159742593765259,0.017415501177310944,0.005292024929076433,-0.04420863837003708,0.049282561987638474,0.07217410951852798,-0.014714062213897705,0.04535374790430069,0.09074552357196808,-0.05672209709882736,-0.043414030224084854,-0.07903087139129639,-0.013577846810221672,0.018043842166662216,-0.01859547384083271,0.015481638722121716,-0.009786799550056458,0.027427291497588158,-0.08387759327888489,0.007742945104837418,0.011280766688287258,0.03843914344906807,0.00419043330475688,-0.01592632196843624,-0.03525729477405548,-0.05371242016553879,-0.0235647764056921,0.04788613319396973,-0.025885626673698425,0.0362255685031414,-0.017443692311644554,0.04974233731627464,0.019423937425017357,0.016168586909770966,-0.04003818333148956,0.08914575725793839,0.009102090261876583,-0.03799928352236748,-0.040683284401893616,0.10722516477108002,-0.01076656486839056,-0.019475620239973068,0.007855958305299282,-0.08202047646045685,0.016001474112272263,-0.02592364139854908,-0.015486428514122963,-0.01898212544620037,-0.05329123139381409,0.0010547402780503035,-0.015811758115887642,-0.037334833294153214,-0.01723889261484146,0.028742695227265358,-0.055719878524541855,0.07845747470855713,0.07093600183725357,-0.057296425104141235,-0.06994489580392838,0.043681155890226364,0.04455515369772911,0.0025618860963732004,-0.00910523533821106,-0.025789951905608177,0.040313053876161575,-0.017915930598974228,-0.0391516387462616,-0.041241101920604706,-0.03637877479195595,0.02714439481496811,-0.02697123773396015,0.08244505524635315,0.01045080367475748,-0.04861201345920563,-0.01964234933257103,0.08357970416545868,-0.014876608736813068,-0.08930846303701401,-0.1637200564146042,-0.020850270986557007,0.06523139029741287,-0.04475758969783783,0.042758096009492874,-3.638721089793298e-33,0.040046632289886475,0.006851965095847845,-0.019149357452988625,0.0482686311006546,-0.04721542447805405,0.03725085034966469,0.09256303310394287,-0.05234524980187416,0.026153502985835075,-0.16735121607780457,-0.07336843013763428,-0.0012143710628151894,-0.011504360474646091,0.03686995804309845,0

{"title":"A  structural and functional investigation of inhibitory synaptic transmission","abstract":"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter of the mammalian central nervous system. Neurons release GABA to shunt or prevent action potentials from propagating in target cells, and this process is critical to providing a dynamic regulation of overall neural circuitry. Chapter 1: I briefly introduce neurotransmission and focus on inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by GABA signaling. Chapter 2: I describe the development of an anti-vGAT recombinant Fab domain used to purify intact inhibitory GABA SVs from mouse brains and the subsequent structural characterization of these vesicles using electron microscopy. I also describe the use of these vesicles in a functional assay that directly probes the membrane association and membrane fusion of GABA synaptic vesicles. The results in this chapter have been published in the journal Current Research in Physiology in their special edition issue on neurotransmitter transporters. Chapter 3: Following the success of the vGAT Fab domain in purifying GABASVs, I describe the development of a molecular toolbox for the isolation and study of other types of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters and SVs using the recombinant Fab domain approach. The results shared in this chapter are preliminary, and the work is ongoing. Chapter 4: I use the recombinant anti-vGAT Fab domain to isolate detergent-solubilized vGAT from rat brains for structural characterization via CryoEM.

{"title":"Probing the neural code of the central retina for vision restoration","abstract":"Interfacing the nervous system with custom electronics that can record and artificially activate neural circuits is a promising way to treat a variety of nervous system disorders. In the retina in particular, epiretinal prostheses are one such neural implant that directly interface with retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by electrically stimulating them, causing them to send visual information to the brain. These devices are used to treat blindness resulting from photoreceptor degeneration, caused by diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. Although modern implants are able to produce light percepts to some degree, the visual percepts are coarse-grained and do not provide useful functional vision, likely because they stimulate RGCs indiscriminately in a manner quite distinct from the natural neural code of the retina. In order to faithfully reproduce the visual neural code of the retina, cellular level control over recording and stimulation are likely required in regions of the retina that support high-acuity vision. In this dissertation, we explore how well visual signals can be reproduced in the central retina of the primate ex vivo using single-electrode epiretinal electrical stimulation as an experimental prototype for a future epiretinal prosthesis.  First, we visually stimulate preparations from the central and peripheral retina with a white noise visual stimulus to classify functionally-distinct RGC types, and fit each RGC with a linear-nonlinear Poisson (LNP) model to determine the light response properties of major RGC types in the central retina, and quantitatively compare them to those in the peripheral retina. Next, we electrically stimulate RGCs in the central retina to determine the level of control over RGC responses that can be achieved using single-electrode epiretinal electrical stimulation. Finally, by combining the LNP model parameters and the responses to single-electrode stimulation, we in simulation exploit a recently-developed stimulation algorithm that optimizes stimulation based on visual reconstruction to determine the quality of visual signals that can be reproduced in the central retina, using electrical stimulation. We find that the functional organization, light response and electrical properties of the major RGC types in the central retina are mostly similar to those in the peripheral, with some differences in density, kinetics, linearity, spiking statistics and correlations. The major RGC types could be distinguished by their intrinsic electrical properties. Electrical stimulation targeting parasol cells revealed similar activation thresholds and reduced axon bundle activation in the central retina, but lower stimulation selectivity. Quantitative evaluation of the potential for image reconstruction from electrically evoked parasol cell signals revealed higher overall expected image quality in the central retina. An exploration of inadvertent midget cell activation suggested that it could contribute high spatial frequency noise to the visual signal carried by parasol cells. These results support the possibility of reproducing high-acuity visual signals in the central retina with an epiretinal implant.  In the final chapter of this dissertation, we explore how well a recently-developed convolutional neural network model of light responses (Deep Retina) can predict population-level responses of major RGC types in the peripheral primate retina, and provide a quantitative comparison to a linear-nonlinear (LN) model. We find that for models trained and evaluated on naturalistic images, Deep Retina outperformed the LN model in both firing rate predictions as well as the quality of the image features that are

{"title":"Design technology co-optimization of energy-efficient digital logic using carbon nanotubes","abstract":"Carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effects transistors (FETs) are promising candidates for high-speed and low-energy digital logic. CNT FETs have been integrated within multiple industrial fabrication facilities at mature technology nodes (e.g., 90/130nm on 200mm silicon wafers). However, understanding CNT energy and delay benefits at extremely scaled nodes (e.g., beyond 2nm) is difficult due to several reasons: 1. CNT FETs have distinct characteristics -- material properties and fabrication techniques -- versus silicon FETs, that directly impact digital logic energy and delay. 2. CNT FET energy efficiency analysis must include CNT FET minimum leakage current. 3. CNT FET digital logic energy and delay exhibit numerous trade-offs, far beyond those for silicon FETs. I address these challenges through new physics-based models using physically meaningful parameters, new CNT FET doping and layout design techniques, and extensive Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO).  To illustrate new physics-based models, I present the extended scale length theory. It captures the differences between CNT FET and silicon FET electrostatics that are crucial for energy and delay estimation. It is used to quantify CNT FET minimum leakage current within 3× vs. experimentally calibrated Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) solvers. In contrast, prior models can underestimate CNFET minimum leakage current by 105×.  Understanding CNT FET digital logic energy and delay trade-offs requires extensive DTCO simulations across many design and technology parameters. My new physics-based models enable fast DTCO: over 350,000 simulations in a few days vs. several months using existing Technology CAD simulators. Such extensive DTCO helps derive CNT FET design and technology parameters with up to 7× projected Energy-Delay Product (EDP) benefits vs. silicon FETs at the 2nm technology node. These DTCO simulations also include a new CNT FET extension doping technique based on the concept of a barrier booster.  A new logic layout technique called Omni 3D exploits CNFET low-temperature fabrication to further enable up to 1.9× additional projected EDP benefits. Several of my thesis contributions extend beyond CNT FETs, e.g., to FETs based on two-dimensional materials.","vector":[0.01726679503917694,0.07924821227788925,0.000887677597347647,0.05122888833284378,0.032767340540885925,0.011362912133336067,0.003456713631749153,0.056113049387931824,0.010334869846701622,-0.00373051012866199,0.007135664112865925,-0.026991834864020348,-0.07628817856311798,0.03213832899928093,0.03172314912080765,-0.02381976507604122,-0.009398892521858215,0.060797348618507385,0.006321596447378397,-0.009273639880120754,0.03837461397051811,0.009242217056453228,0.033619094640016556,-0.027990998700261116,-0.062073785811662674,-0.09871287643909454,0.052778128534555435,-0.02348989062011242,0.017780311405658722,-0.05277121812105179,-0.07098378241062164,0.0042524514719843864,-0.08342514932155609,0.04264922812581062,-0.0021912201773375273,0.020557403564453125,0.10003123432397842,-0.0261770561337471,0.04837105795741081,-0.014760180376470089,0.035278525203466415,-0.010336154140532017,0.047470442950725555,0.0359669029712677,0.059440843760967255,-0.06941070407629013,0.03250737860798836,-0.06026366725564003,-0.01520456187427044,-0.066865473985672,0.08297313004732132,-0.014078540727496147,0.018599858507514,0.03015550971031189,0.028380244970321655,0.01059433352202177,0.07664858549833298,-0.021185779944062233,0.007232629228383303,0.05148017033934593,-0.028917264193296432,-0.1324034482240677,0.016980374231934547,-0.013606095686554909,0.043727580457925797,0.027811605483293533,0.040761638432741165,-0.05845019966363907,-0.013162458315491676,-0.01317622046917677,-0.05371490493416786,-0.028578532859683037,-0.08012543618679047,0.015279523096978664,-0.012136764824390411,-0.009050613269209862,0.07880594581365585,0.0771910548210144,-0.026714930310845375,0.008556549437344074,-0.06219151243567467,-0.014347773976624012,0.028713585808873177,-0.09135599434375763,-0.014397752471268177,0.06524831056594849,-0.031528640538454056,0.050434406846761703,-0.026543358340859413,0.011004917323589325,0.013249734416604042,-0.026108302175998688,-0.09066919982433319,-0.006999317556619644,0.037865880876779556,-0.13460341095924377,0.032496385276317596,-0.009182022884488106,-0.037754882127046585,-0.026105258613824844,0.05572744086384773,0.06501585245132446,-0.027669183909893036,0.0636175200343132,0.02494591474533081,0.04183200001716614,0.027713743969798088,0.0772569552063942,0.005915023852139711,0.0067117600701749325,0.04637710377573967,0.034610237926244736,-0.03546619415283203,0.004381463397294283,-0.03650454059243202,-0.02532881684601307,-0.000473682361189276,-0.04154789447784424,0.0817670077085495,-0.008931511081755161,0.012868385761976242,0.04466317966580391,-0.08353574573993683,-0.04379444941878319,-0.03637263551354408,-0.025137437507510185,-0.08403334766626358,3.718460014397358e-33,-0.019896311685442924,0.006976617965847254,0.04044722020626068,0.023010995239019394,0.09252039343118668,0.05196113884449005,0.03964667394757271,0.0531664602458477,0.007533073890954256,-0.0238106157630682,-0.051119234412908554,-0.04585449397563934,-0.017473045736551285,-0.014806116931140423,-0.02601633034646511,-0.03507876396179199,0.0015373040223494172,-0.0332321859896183,0.0011505094589665532,-0.029726166278123856,0.06975910067558289,-0.06211736425757408,0.04364624619483948,0.0875629112124443,0.06698713451623917,-0.0945894867181778,-0.07071830332279205,0.056805770844221115,-0.0802072212100029,-0.0071634566411376,-0.10465812683105469,0.01220322959125042,0.020529665052890778,-0.04256930202245712,-0.019091667607426643,-0.051027558743953705,0.07119528949260712,-0.039499908685684204,0.059825971722602844,-0.05804135277867317,-0.025744548067450523,0.03566775843501091,0.015154141932725906,-0.04867246001958847,-0.07649314403533936,-0.05103720352053642,0.0599830262362957,0.005987661890685558,-0.011944451369345188,0.02985491417348385,0.012500361539423466,0.040990669280290604,-0.05603072792291641,-0.0384613573551178,0.10056916624307632,-0.035998761653900146,0.03223066404461861,0.003506358480080962,0.04743613302707672,0.13724248111248016,-0.006092550698667765,-0.01709682121872902,-0.004629859700798988,0.06608489155769348,-0.05776730179786682,0.09315585345029831,-0.03917389735579491,0.031239084899425507,0.01382332295179367,-0.04566467925906181,0.045498643070459366,0.047522321343421936,0.06960506737232208,-0.08543744683265686,0.07094825804233551,-0.04721076413989067,-0.01663096249103546,-0.17046859860420227,0.024172289296984673,-0.012868569232523441,0.0006808900507166982,-0.025281060487031937,-0.0032328676898032427,-0.031089529395103455,-0.048053842037916183,-0.058334242552518845,0.012553350068628788,0.02531702257692814,0.007406841963529587,-0.10950690507888794,-0.04771692305803299,0.01379117090255022,0.04113724082708359,-0.03177805617451668,-0.06399586796760559,-4.337771784521973e-33,0.008402148261666298,-0.014753411523997784,0.015844549983739853,0.0035437133628875017,0.04664654657244682,-0.056868135929107666,-0.04770515859127045,0.0205850787460804,0.037043496966362,-0.03309023007750511,0.008149808272719383,-0.04200601950287819,-0.045373257249593735,-0.0428711138665676

The expansion of protein structure databases due to experimental and computational advances provides an unprecedented opportunity to learn structure-function relationships in a data-driven manner. Deep learning methods that operate on protein structures have shown promise for specific tasks, but their utility for functional analysis has been limited due to inconsistencies in model training and evaluation, lack of labeled protein function data, and an inability to reconcile global predictions with local biochemical mechanisms. In this dissertation, I explore these challenges and propose a framework for protein analysis based on learning on local sites rather than the entire protein structure. First, to establish standards for model development and evaluation, I present work on (1) developing a suite of benchmark datasets, processing tools, and baseline models, and (2) quantifying the effect of differing structure compositions in the training data. I then describe a self-supervised learning method that leverages evolutionary relationships to learn general-purpose representations of local structural sites, and show how these representations enable improved performance on downstream tasks involving classification, search, and annotation of functional sites. By clustering millions of sites, I propose a framework for protein analysis based on conserved structural motifs which enables the discovery of functional relationships across protein classes. Finally, I present a method for explainable function annotation that predicts the overall function of a protein as well as the individual residues which are responsible.","vector":[-0.005492052063345909,-0.11269856989383698,0.007103086914867163,0.005035537760704756,0.04033244028687477,-0.0063194893300533295,-0.019448749721050262,0.0015095439739525318,0.03534434363245964,-0.07615641504526138,-0.027214189991354942,-0.08513092994689941,-0.022710511460900307,0.13971452414989471,-0.0460977740585804,-0.0019372979877516627,0.013260182924568653,0.0633634552359581,-0.044071998447179794,-0.009689545258879662,0.03341754898428917,0.07002466171979904,0.0707879289984703,0.061433643102645874,0.013009856455028057,-0.006116389762610197,0.023928159847855568,-0.0007835669675841928,-0.03218000382184982,-0.07165063917636871,0.08958326280117035,-0.045874714851379395,-0.010770863853394985,-0.003349315607920289,0.012003723531961441,0.046755217015743256,-0.053054943680763245,-0.01055317185819149,-0.021240662783384323,-0.059493839740753174,0.07307576388120651,0.009836491197347641,0.04693516343832016,0.01927480660378933,0.07358428090810776,0.04728797450661659,0.0069245826452970505,-0.037739671766757965,0.08496465533971786,0.07830628752708435,-0.02301935851573944,-0.031001081690192223,-0.0659291222691536,0.08433760702610016,0.028897147625684738,0.03036823309957981,0.01226823404431343,-0.04744863137602806,-0.06346120685338974,-0.01955285482108593,0.07009460031986237,-0.0632224902510643,-0.002542652655392885,-0.017593910917639732,0.03308563306927681,0.007531220559030771,0.03681808337569237,0.062105726450681686,-0.043000344187021255,-0.002274223370477557,0.03706502541899681,0.06695563346147537,-0.05869336053729057,0.08609610050916672,0.07739725708961487,0.030567863956093788,-0.031549520790576935,0.0560445636510849,0.0508330874145031,-0.0733862891793251,0.03328755125403404,0.0632098838686943,0.1015399768948555,0.07419392466545105,0.11207618564367294,-0.029715891927480698,-0.01107601635158062,-0.0007698729168623686,-0.011455312371253967,-0.01649666577577591,0.04905111342668533,-0.00847781915217638,-0.022441240027546883,-0.040971528738737106,-0.008588180877268314,0.012244201265275478,0.03817480802536011,-0.10402591526508331,0.0017652047099545598,0.06257861107587814,-0.02379102259874344,0.02643679641187191,0.05759050324559212,-0.06714347749948502,0.024228079244494438,0.08040875941514969,-0.04357772693037987,0.10170184075832367,0.03622489050030708,-0.05110315605998039,0.038790442049503326,0.050793103873729706,7.947091944515705e-05,0.0017300754552707076,0.07313784956932068,-0.0024092516396194696,0.006219116505235434,-0.07361970841884613,0.055689189583063126,0.057269711047410965,-0.02900005877017975,-0.040373027324676514,0.007774678990244865,0.05866287648677826,-0.030110269784927368,0.018980080261826515,-0.16696418821811676,1.0931889914425957e-33,0.06692585349082947,0.0036720894277095795,0.02299751713871956,0.03942367061972618,-0.02005772292613983,-0.07287702709436417,-0.005681123584508896,0.008673341944813728,-0.05989740788936615,0.062404565513134,-0.037822823971509933,-0.01959218829870224,0.0496777668595314,0.052251748740673065,0.07346045970916748,0.008128663524985313,0.012774602510035038,0.014648434706032276,0.011525396257638931,-0.0348220057785511,-0.0213253665715456,0.002666865475475788,0.026208646595478058,-0.05957246944308281,0.03712620586156845,0.003318867878988385,-0.05034109577536583,0.011011387221515179,-0.1197611466050148,0.004346526227891445,-0.11339868605136871,0.011270499788224697,-0.050093960016965866,0.03486836329102516,0.08526837080717087,-0.04448341205716133,0.037187617272138596,-0.0649503692984581,-0.036363523453474045,-0.012053905986249447,0.04231054708361626,-0.00651879608631134,-0.043271470814943314,-0.04325665533542633,-0.023233382031321526,-0.010858352296054363,0.03264353796839714,-0.04294758662581444,-0.049652040004730225,-0.06801741570234299,0.06160390004515648,-0.026592718437314034,0.06104498729109764,-0.005672318860888481,-0.09287142753601074,0.0853475034236908,-0.07485811412334442,0.03079276718199253,0.08085016906261444,0.030563153326511383,0.009761221706867218,0.020044678822159767,-0.058113399893045425,0.0599893294274807,-0.030631592497229576,-0.00010068524716189131,-0.0461670383810997,0.008951911702752113,0.08839988708496094,0.008759469725191593,-0.009930668398737907,0.06632217019796371,0.04012644663453102,-0.08425141125917435,0.04848378151655197,-0.0030756264459341764,-0.008934172801673412,-0.07507199048995972,-0.05467650666832924,0.10456497967243195,0.03233524411916733,0.05123443901538849,-0.05079447478055954,0.027833782136440277,-0.03828253224492073,-0.09779483824968338,0.11346011608839035,-0.1059638038277626,-0.0738544836640358,-0.022232750430703163,-0.05575576424598694,-0.03884825482964516,0.0027649193070828915,-0.0017599124694243073,-0.020175186917185783,-2.496874530079329e-33,0.011378648690879345,-0.028711481019854546,0.029304370284080505,-0.08565328270196915,-0.0170102771371603,-0.03711304813623428,-0.03759218379855156,0.0076906634494662285,-0.008646187372505665,-0.04339292272925377,0.0494643971323967,-0.03507303446531296,0.01718936674296856,-0.03036154061555

{"title":"Putting the reversibility of lithium batteries under the microscope : dissolved cathode species, water impurities, and artificial protection layers","abstract":"This thesis presents a comprehensive examination of the critical components influencing the performance and longevity of lithium batteries, with a particular focus on the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and its integral role in battery stability and functionality. Through a series of meticulous studies, the thesis leverages advanced characterization and analytical techniques to unravel the complex mechanisms at play within battery anodes and proposes innovative strategies to mitigate performance degradation.  In Chapter 1, the thesis begins with a comprehensive introduction to rechargeable lithium battery technology, tracing its evolution from the foundational work of Goodenough, Yoshino, and Whittingham to the latest developments in advanced battery research. This historical perspective encompasses significant innovations like lithium metal, silicon anodes, and sulfur cathodes, illustrating the continuous pursuit of higher energy density, enhanced safety, and cost-effectiveness. The chapter not only introduces fundamental concepts, particularly emphasizing the pivotal role of lithium metal anodes, but also delves into the unique failure mechanisms inherent to different battery chemistries. Highlighting the advanced characterization and analytical tools play in identifying and understanding  failure mechanisms of battery materials. This sets the stage for the subsequent in-depth investigations and establishes a framework for understanding the current state, challenges, and future prospects of lithium battery technology, underlining its significance in the broader context of electrification and sustainability efforts.  Chapter 2 delves into the detrimental effects of dissolved transition metals, particularly nickel, from high-voltage cathodes on the performance and lifespan of lithium metal anodes. Through the use of cryogenic electron microscopy, the study unveils the intricate process of nickel incorporation into the SEI and its profound impact on the SEI's chemistry and nanostructure. This incorporation is shown to alter the transport properties of lithium ions and electrons within the SEI, expediting electrolyte decomposition, fostering the formation of \"dead\" lithium, and ultimately triggering battery failure.  Chapter 3 shifts the focus to the formation of lithium hydride (LiH) within lithium batteries and its implications on battery efficiency and safety. The chapter presents groundbreaking findings on the formation mechanism of LiH, demonstrating that hydrogen gas, a byproduct of cycling in Li batteries, reacts with deposited lithium metal to form LiH, thus consuming active lithium and diminishing battery capacity. The discovery demonstrates that LiH, a wide-bandgap insulator, electrically isolates metallic lithium from the current collector adds a new dimension to understanding battery degradation. Furthermore, the identification of LiH on various anode chemistries, each with its distinct SEI layer, underscores the significance of this degradation pathway across different lithium battery systems.  In Chapter 4, the thesis explores the potential of interfacial coatings, specifically nanometer-scale aluminum oxide (Al2O3) coatings on carbon negative electrodes, to enhance lithium-ion battery performance. The research delineates the transformative changes in the SEI's structure and chemistry induced by Al2O3 coatings during SEI formation at low potentials. The findings illuminate the critical role of the refined SEI structure, chemistry, and uniformity in elevating battery performance, challenging the prevailing notion that performance enhancements are solely attributable to the physical presence of the coatings.  Finally, Chapter 5 combines the insights from the preceding chapters, offering a comprehensive summary of the thesis and projecting an outlook for the field. It emphasizes the importance of the interplay between electrolyte composition, SEI structure, and electrode material in determining the performance and durability of lithium batteries. The chapter proposes directions for future research, focusing on understanding failure mechanisms in extreme conditions and emerging battery chemistries.  Overall, this thesis contributes significantly to the field of battery technology by providing a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions within lithium battery anodes and paving the way for

{"title":"Marine predator effects on ecosystem function and connectivity across spatiotemporal scales","abstract":"Marine predator populations worldwide are experiencing ubiquitous declines from a myriad of anthropogenic threats, including over harvesting, by-catch, and ecosystem degradation due to climate change. However, many of the ecological consequences of these losses are poorly understood, particularly regarding how they may influence biological connectivity and the overall function of marine ecosystems. Large mobile consumers create functional and energetic linkages between physically separated habitats as they feed on diverse prey populations. These interactions have important consequences for food web structure, habitat connectivity, and ecosystem stability, yet our understanding of these connections is still largely theoretical, especially regarding how these effects scale across time and space. In this dissertation I investigate the role of mobile marine predator roles in shaping ecosystem function and connectivity through three studies conducted at differing spatial scales in the North Pacific. In Chapter 1, I use a stable isotope (SI) aggregate dataset compiled from the literature to construct novel multi-taxa isoscapes and investigate large-scale trophic dynamics across Longhurst biogeographic provinces. Results indicate that baseline isotopic signatures are consistently propagated up through regional food webs and, further, that global modeled phytoplankton isoscapes may be a viable tool for predicting consumer SI ratios across trophic levels and regions. This chapter furthers fundamental knowledge of how large-scale existing datasets might be harnessed to study regional trophodynamics and mobile predator movement. Chapter 2 presents an examination of how spatiotemporal scale effects the interpretation of large spatial datasets for highly migratory marine predators and consequences for understanding life history and vulnerabilities. Using satellite tracking data for 128 female salmon sharks (Lamna ditropis), I identify previously unknown distribution patterns and potential foraging hotspots as well as potential overlap with commercial fishing effort in the California Current region, an area where they have been previously described but whose role has been poorly understood. Based on known life history and hypotheses in the literature, I conclude that this region might provide critical foraging habitat related to complex multi-year reproductive cycles, demonstrating the importance of its consideration in future management and conservation. In Chapter 3, I investigate the ecological traits and conditions underlying cross-ecosystem dietary reliance among a diverse group of predatory fish species in a coral reef-open ocean system. I collected SI carbon and nitrogen data for 33 fish species and found significant evidence that dietary mixing occurred across all predator species and guilds sampled. Primary habitat association, water column use, and diet strategy appeared to be the primary determinant of dietary mixing, with mobile reef mesopredators being the most dependent on cross habitat resources. I conclude that SI data in combination with life history knowledge might be used to predict the occurrence of cross-ecosystem provisioning and its implications for marine spatial management and conservation. Overall, this dissertation fills knowledge gaps of how mobile marine predator shape and connect marine ecosystems and emphasizes the importance of considering how these interactions scale across

{"title":"PMC : a classification of production metrics found useful by AEC professionals","abstract":"A modern paradigm considers AEC projects to be temporary production systems.  Through rapid feedback, production metrics (PM) provide a chance to project teams to control these production systems by adjusting their actions and decisions in a timely manner, making it more likely for projects to stay on track.  Observation of PM reported (PMR) through the Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) certificate program conducted by the Stanford Center for Professional Development (SCPD) revealed that AEC professionals are missing a common PM vocabulary, which hinders establishing and reporting PM consistently.  While a limited number of PM, such as PPC (percent plan complete), number of RFIs (requests for information), number of changer orders, and number of clashes detected, are gaining widespread adoption in the AEC industry, it isn't clear whether there are other PM which AEC professionals are finding useful and whether they are generalizable across a variety of projects.  This thesis contributes a classification of production metrics found useful by ~600 AEC professionals managing a variety of project production systems.  The professionals represent ~100 AEC companies engaged as owners, designers, and builders on ~300 projects of different types (building, infrastructure, industrial) in 10 countries on 2 continents.  The contribution, presented in this dissertation as the production metrics classification (PMC), was generated through several rounds of content analysis and expert reviews of 1,971 PMR by professionals enrolled in the 1st large-scale VDC certificate program, and was validated through a survey administered at the 2nd program.  It consists of 96 PM grouped into 3 categories and 17 sub-categories.  36 of the 96 PM relate to collaboration, 17 relate to information generation and use, and 43 relate to workflows for managing project production systems.  37 of the 96 PM relate to conformance while 59 relate to performance.  7 PM are likely to be measured daily and 70 are likely to be measured weekly.  33 PM can be measured immediately after an activity is performed and are therefore, likely to improve in the short term, i.e., within a week of adjusting actions and decisions, while others are likely to take longer.    The PMC addresses a conceptual gap in the literature by providing clarity on specific PM found useful in project production systems.  It provides a foundation for future research to establish control mechanisms in AEC production systems based on feedback provided by specific PM.  In addition, it opens pathways for establishing correlations between specific PM and project

{"title":"Open-air manufacturing of perovskite solar modules","abstract":"Metal halide perovskites have emerged over the last 10 years as a strong candidate for next generation solar energy production with record device efficiencies of >26% competing with state-of-the-art incumbent crystalline silicon devices. The rapid rise in perovskite performance, combined with their solution processability and low-cost fabrication compared to conventional physical and chemical vapor-based deposition methods, demonstrates a pathway towards meeting the global energy demand. However, high performance solution-processed perovskite devices are typically fabricated on areas as small as 0.1 cm2, demonstrating a significant scaling barrier for commercialization and deployment. Additionally, while perovskites enable solution processing of low-cost earth-abundant materials, complementary device layers often rely on low-throughput vacuum-based processes, negating many of the cost benefits promised by perovskite solar energy. Here, an open-air spray deposition platform is proposed as a high-throughput, scalable route for the production of low-cost perovskite solar modules. Rapid Spray Plasma Processing (RSPP) is first presented as a platform for producing robust, high-performing large-area perovskite films in open air at linear processing speeds of 12 m/min. RSPP is paired with indirect liftoff laser scribing to produce perovskite modules with >25 cm2 active areas, optimizing for low-cost laser systems and consistent module performance across a broad range of active areas. The open-air spray deposition platform built around the RSPP technique is extended to the entire perovskite device, demonstrating the commercial benefit of open-air manufacturing with complete technoeconomic analysis translating lab-scale optimizations directly to MW-scale module manufacturing costs and demonstrating a pathway towards the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) target of $0.02/kWh.","vector":[-0.03769362345337868,0.04221593588590622,-0.015046827495098114,0.0002478355308994651,0.07622719556093216,-0.019977539777755737,0.09370202571153641,0.0173962339758873,0.027942592278122902,-0.011635676957666874,-0.05363121256232262,0.005994079634547234,0.0029563880525529385,0.005052029155194759,0.04392130672931671,0.05657127872109413,0.1168312206864357,0.02767653949558735,0.02290366403758526,0.045080188661813736,0.0428958386182785,-0.08604006469249725,0.00409621000289917,-0.04575046896934509,-0.00763075752183795,0.09319289773702621,-0.042416490614414215,-0.015728451311588287,-0.003574441885575652,0.03101496584713459,-0.034624770283699036,0.028773285448551178,-0.049254484474658966,0.004103834740817547,0.1075495257973671,0.0068543218076229095,-0.03417528048157692,0.013737653382122517,-0.10420900583267212,0.002315376652404666,-0.011942332610487938,-0.014855836518108845,-0.020250696688890457,0.024664878845214844,0.00042712624417617917,0.01214560680091381,0.11763299256563187,0.015990374609827995,0.01827545464038849,-0.041130103170871735,-0.005333964247256517,-0.016673168167471886,0.04345613718032837,-0.013017828576266766,-0.04803340882062912,-0.0703263059258461,-0.02088501863181591,0.06762697547674179,-0.09931153804063797,-0.020673859864473343,-0.014622203074395657,-0.13129955530166626,-0.02180774137377739,-0.025751173496246338,-0.04352229833602905,-0.011554750613868237,-0.022048640996217728,-0.0037438026629388332,-0.03619794547557831,-0.05816660448908806,0.0012261513620615005,0.07284627854824066,-0.07251102477312088,0.016816342249512672,0.003307195845991373,0.02591543085873127,0.028663603588938713,0.012467436492443085,0.04346715658903122,-0.038509368896484375,0.0035064509138464928,0.03627082705497742,-0.07462500035762787,0.03393544629216194,-0.06526916474103928,0.061829425394535065,-0.014119010418653488,0.04477717727422714,-0.01425690297037363,-0.058550622314214706,-0.02962571009993553,0.07720544934272766,-0.060980889946222305,-0.0468188039958477,-0.018907666206359863,0.033912383019924164,-0.027792761102318764,-0.009244203567504883,0.013189530931413174,-0.010869286023080349,-0.03798023611307144,0.0028903952334076166,-0.008631935343146324,-0.0019983623642474413,-0.06421348452568054,-0.053415533155202866,-0.018596233800053596,0.06132696196436882,-0.06074649095535278,0.008587082847952843,-0.07488685101270676,0.03928418457508087,0.012280605733394623,0.019907310605049133,0.08472386002540588,-0.018227750435471535,-0.026971319690346718,-0.02455676905810833,0.02475927211344242,-0.042036477476358414,-0.0718049705028534,0.011333058588206768,-0.04423399642109871,0.08602546155452728,0.0395190455019474,0.027617745101451874,-0.002329393522813916,3.519799999740453e-33,0.049765609204769135,0.09958815574645996,0.03960813581943512,-0.03619080409407616,-0.1645844429731369,0.09155508875846863,0.10368748009204865,0.03470660746097565,-0.025355683639645576,0.01864861696958542,0.002470211125910282,-0.11118001490831375,0.03729270398616791,0.04210131987929344,0.05120207369327545,-0.0910949632525444,0.07391026616096497,-0.008958812803030014,-0.024580851197242737,0.03404548019170761,-0.0012730092275887728,0.004570606164634228,0.024825621396303177,0.043350037187337875,0.017209017649292946,-0.007178270723670721,0.08067592978477478,-0.053560517728328705,-0.10521125048398972,-0.01310766488313675,-0.002109022345393896,0.07978440076112747,0.0552435964345932,-0.06780924648046494,-0.02107396349310875,-0.017102526500821114,-0.10201165825128555,-0.0018847056198865175,0.052750684320926666,-0.09807784110307693,-0.08216848224401474,0.07182656228542328,-0.08187343925237656,0.005957289133220911,-0.008216187357902527,-0.02542700618505478,-0.026431450620293617,0.04326010122895241,-0.014909612014889717,-0.08437123894691467,0.02195090800523758,0.12981481850147247,0.003806113265454769,0.049069978296756744,0.04483504593372345,0.023660952225327492,0.06858835369348526,-0.06070435047149658,0.02125471644103527,0.07103618234395981,-0.004601052962243557,-0.019342541694641113,-0.09238389134407043,0.07435816526412964,-0.05175446346402168,-0.005992143414914608,0.05398249253630638,0.14328184723854065,0.0014458015793934464,-0.01371054444462061,0.05100807175040245,-0.057146746665239334,0.030701767653226852,-0.009736872278153896,0.0016977033810690045,0.0035717557184398174,0.02514168806374073,-0.01133155357092619,0.088213250041008,-0.03520181402564049,-0.04921402409672737,-0.01028515212237835,0.0075527667067945,-0.06407751888036728,-0.08458597213029861,-0.08038203418254852,-0.002969247056171298,0.041567228734493256,-0.008444839157164097,-0.040853094309568405,0.05276323854923248,-0.03082953207194805,0.08353205770254135,0.0051183984614908695,-0.13579648733139038,-4.394197350071366e-33,0.05818086490035057,-0.07868572324514389,-0.029689833521842957,-0.028441494330763817,0.04468139261007309,0.03627225011587143,-0.002033059950917959,-0.01784702204167843,0.0193693395704031,0.003882244462147355,-0.042247623205184937,0.01755109429359436,0.05717131868004799,0.010

{"title":"Toward the next generation of GPS signals : new codes and navigation security","abstract":"Today, billions of users rely on GPS on a daily basis. Woven into the fabric of modern civilization, GPS underlies nearly every aspect of society's functions, including our transportation, agriculture, financial transactions, energy grid, and communication systems. Yet, despite the critical importance of GPS, its civilian signals currently (1) are open and unencrypted, meaning that an attacker can generate counterfeit GPS signals and spoof a user's position or timing solution, and (2) use codes which were designed before the recent advancements in computing. However, in 2024, the NTS-3 satellite will be launched to test new signal capabilities for the future generations of GPS, including a new digital watermark called Chimera to periodically authenticate one's received GPS signal. Furthermore, starting launches in 2026, the GPS IIIF satellites will be the first to have a fully-digital, reprogrammable payload, allowing for new opportunities to re-explore the design of the GPS signal, including their underlying codes.  In this dissertation, we seek to leverage these upcoming opportunities in order to advance the next-generation signal capabilities. In particular, we develop strategies to utilize Chimera and additional self-contained sensors onboard a vehicle, such as an inertial measurement unit or wheel encoder, in order to perform continuous spoofing detection and secure, attack-resilient navigation. For our continuous spoofing detector, we use stochastic reachability analysis to conservatively model the error distributions from the self-contained sensor and GPS measurements, in order to provably satisfy a user-defined false alarm guarantee. To perform continuous, attack-resilient navigation, we further leverage the self-contained sensors and Chimera to determine how much to rely on the received GPS measurements, in order to strategically improve real-time navigation performance while mitigating any induced errors during an experienced attack.  With the forthcoming ability to reprogram the GPS signals, this dissertation further proposes a new framework to design the GPS codes, leveraging stochastic optimization methods as well as present-day computational tools. To design the GPS codes within the discrete, exponentially large space of binary code sets, we utilize a natural evolution strategy to optimize a smooth probability distribution over the code space, allowing us to evaluate a gradient estimate and leverage state-of-the-art first-order optimization algorithms for code design. We demonstrate that the framework proposed in this dissertation designs codes which have lower self- and inter-signal interference, through reduced mean-squared correlation sidelobes, than competitive

{"title":"High-integrity urban localization : bringing safety in aviation to autonomous driving","abstract":"Localization is a crucial function for autonomous vehicles (AVs), as it influences critical tasks such as perception, planning, and control.  However, most existing localization systems focus on accuracy and may fail unexpectedly in challenging conditions, posing safety risks.  To address this issue, this thesis proposes novel algorithms that prioritize safety along with accuracy for localization.  These algorithms not only robustly estimate the location, but also continuously assess its reliability.  Drawing inspiration from the principles of integrity monitoring -- a safety-centric framework used in aviation for reliable Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based localization -- this thesis aims to adapt these principles for assessing location reliability in autonomous driving. However, directly applying this framework to autonomous driving, particularly in urban environments, presents significant challenges. Unlike the well-characterized GNSS errors observed in open-sky conditions of aviation, localization errors in urban settings are more unpredictable and severe. Moreover, the variety of sensors employed in AV localization, such as GNSS, cameras, and inertial sensors, require effectively handling the limitations and combined effects of each sensor on the localization process.   In this thesis, we present novel algorithms that utilize different sensors to improve localization and enable integrity monitoring in urban environments. These algorithms are tailored to handle various challenges that affect the reliability of the localization process, such as large errors in multiple GNSS measurements, high-dimensional errors in visual measurements, and combined effects of errors from different sensors. For these challenges, we develop strategies to mitigate the impact of large errors on localization, estimate the error bounds of the localization solution, or detect when the localization error exceeds a threshold. We also describe how these algorithms can be implemented efficiently for fast computation in AVs and show how they provide a better understanding of the localization reliability than existing methods.  We test our algorithms on simulated and real-world data from urban environments. The results show that our algorithms can estimate the vehicle's position reliably and robustly, and also evaluate the integrity of the localization solution.","vector":[0.032536450773477554,-0.06393758207559586,-0.017052961513400078,-0.026876913383603096,0.113388292491436,-0.026356978341937065,0.09995424002408981,-0.07173372805118561,-0.010308013297617435,0.032788537442684174,-0.004339052364230156,-0.010660980828106403,0.025838810950517654,0.010516674257814884,-0.1382834017276764,-0.02712661400437355,0.07509581744670868,0.057813841849565506,-0.08274441957473755,-0.03183439001441002,-0.0045623756013810635,0.10156318545341492,0.03405735269188881,0.14120511710643768,0.003337101312354207,0.003664401127025485,0.007853090763092041,-0.02501569129526615,-0.027117418125271797,-0.009574582800269127,0.016502100974321365,-0.04535534605383873,-0.041362013667821884,0.02250388078391552,-0.030459530651569366,0.005178192164748907,-0.0235886387526989,-0.06056305766105652,-0.029499633237719536,-0.0015933351824060082,0.038820598274469376,-0.003141905879601836,0.06109585985541344,-0.002867463743314147,-0.007140450179576874,0.051217518746852875,0.07574563473463058,0.03805956244468689,0.053619153797626495,0.0005092389183118939,-0.05044105648994446,0.021664520725607872,0.003032451728358865,-0.07591965794563293,-0.026489360257983208,0.04625318944454193,-0.054479729384183884,-0.01109842024743557,-0.00246369163505733,0.011816831305623055,0.0330759659409523,0.03525587171316147,-0.03828506916761398,0.032466888427734375,-0.007441100664436817,0.05026993528008461,0.014109213836491108,-0.004993398208171129,0.003380079288035631,0.06755118817090988,-0.02145198918879032,0.0586184486746788,0.044193197041749954,0.05068843811750412,0.00528052868321538,0.015763072296977043,-0.030473515391349792,-0.019101038575172424,-0.020740091800689697,-0.006606624461710453,0.029380930587649345,-0.016149170696735382,0.03501037508249283,0.09924869984388351,0.09653603285551071,-0.03904946520924568,0.014041402377188206,0.07621931284666061,0.09121305495500565,-0.060678910464048386,-0.017099592834711075,-0.03835352510213852,0.010853762738406658,0.015190290287137032,0.11168500781059265,-0.03246789798140526,-0.01415221393108368,-0.07657918334007263,0.051399603486061096,-0.007463765796273947,-0.04707428440451622,-0.012097575701773167,-0.01755497232079506,0.06257829815149307,0.03569755703210831,0.022135358303785324,0.021828360855579376,0.0021004679147154093,0.03259598836302757,0.04227079823613167,0.007680652663111687,0.005149342585355043,0.003326504025608301,0.02513040602207184,-0.036762677133083344,-0.014982011169195175,-0.06440958380699158,0.0465800017118454,-0.007654967717826366,0.015974795445799828,-0.06224527582526207,-0.06936085969209671,0.09932106733322144,0.0122771505266428,0.015770694240927696,0.010943454690277576,0.08902889490127563,-1.2082982655564104e-33,-0.04508548602461815,0.04015005752444267,0.029476210474967957,0.038615766912698746,-0.02644122764468193,-0.014183762483298779,-0.06935630738735199,-0.014553324319422245,-0.028261985629796982,0.04951510950922966,0.010903134942054749,-0.03544975072145462,-0.041722748428583145,-0.05134117230772972,0.1180339977145195,0.10236521065235138,0.06321842968463898,0.002445385092869401,-0.10692223906517029,0.04783466085791588,0.03775382786989212,-0.11247114092111588,0.026215355843305588,-0.047247469425201416,0.03716786578297615,0.03310912474989891,0.04505736380815506,0.1151847094297409,-0.010670761577785015,-0.022138450294733047,-0.00988758634775877,0.03878521919250488,-0.01391757745295763,0.03545241057872772,0.008248957805335522,0.001162898843176663,-0.09758047759532928,-0.0036866511218249798,-0.04127347841858864,0.03786308318376541,0.013399527408182621,0.021527022123336792,-0.053765278309583664,-0.028773775324225426,0.050851766020059586,-0.0019800288137048483,-0.05478573217988014,-0.046087443828582764,0.020518040284514427,0.060548748821020126,0.007193300873041153,0.01655447855591774,-0.05045652389526367,-0.005386143922805786,-0.052487924695014954,0.011125253513455391,0.02355777472257614,-0.018648255616426468,-0.008685247041285038,-0.054953593760728836,-0.05902370437979698,-0.045980844646692276,-0.0052157011814415455,-0.0694681853055954,0.04152575135231018,0.01762431301176548,0.02446729689836502,0.05201154202222824,0.04785710945725441,-0.040533822029829025,0.004408356733620167,-0.02785591036081314,0.04913310334086418,0.06325045973062515,-0.030657872557640076,0.014952290803194046,-0.0352075919508934,-0.010078626684844494,-0.0034934883005917072,-0.03401278704404831,-0.04415300488471985,0.035303179174661636,-0.07479505985975266,0.0505669005215168,0.030641159042716026,-0.02027338743209839,-0.05064396187663078,-0.021980538964271545,-0.062461718916893005,0.00879555381834507,-0.04476786404848099,-0.06495286524295807,-0.03413348272442818,-0.03730234503746033,-0.13817012310028076,-1.0355832479320764e-33,0.0019718303810805082,-0.09431841969490051,0.06401509046554565,0.06268275529146194,-0.07532870769500732,-0.10142761468887329,-0.019398335367441177,0.02268897369503975,0.06195816397666931,-0.02789394184947014,-0.1497931331396103,-0.029782382771372795,0.07949855923652649,0.057

{"title":"Neural heuristics for mixed-integer configuration optimization","abstract":"In design and optimization, engineers commonly rely on computational tools to assist in determining and specifying the necessary features and parameters that comprise the solution to the design problem. In general, however, certain predicate assumptions are made outside the scope of the formal design process. Configuration selection - determining major, non-parameterized design features - is frequently and significantly often accomplished by brainstorming or eschewed altogether in favor of simply updating a pre-existing configuration with new features that fit inside its pre-established envelope.  For example, a new generation of an airplane or an automobile may incorporate a new engine. Still, the placement of that engine under the wing as opposed to over it or within the engine bay ahead of the passenger compartment as opposed to behind it are configuration choices that are unlikely to be re-considered in most design problems. Like engine placement, fuel type, or structural material selection, configuration choices are those whose implications are far-reaching in the design of other system elements. Changing any of them results in a need to fully re-assess the performance of a proposed solution using different analysis methods.  The multiplicity of possible solutions to design problems often outstrips designers' ability to assess the performance of different possible configurations comprehensively. As such, informal brainstorming or updating from prior design points serve as \"heuristics\" for searching the design space. They produce viable answers but do not follow formally specified rules that can be analyzed and improved upon. Several formal methods or algorithms for configuration design are extant in the literature - notably evolutionary optimizers, simulated annealing methods, and conventional mixed-integer optimizers. These approaches either rely on designer foreknowledge of the structure and trade-offs within the design space or provide little to provide an understanding of such structure and trade-offs in the way the informal methods do.  This work develops several advancements that enable the application of artificial intelligence to the problem of engineering design. In particular, it develops the theory and methods necessary to deploy generative neural networks as optimization heuristics in an architecture labeled GEMINI for \"Generative Evolutionary Mixed-Integer Network Interpreter.\" GEMINI can provide both recommendations for solutions to the design problems and, as a result of its training procedure, a structured distribution over all possible designs indicating their likely performance. This work covers several theoretical points behind both configuration optimization and artificial intelligence via machine learning:  Conceptual-level design problems germane to aerospace applications are covered in detail, and an approach is developed to formalize the relationship between possible configurations of design solutions and mixed-integer optimization problems.  Artificial intelligence is approached as a matter of epistemology, formalized via probability theory and actualized by a paradigm of Data, Model, and Loss to reflect the actual machinery involved and how it is variously applied across fields of engineering and science.  Shortcomings in state-of-the-art methods in both configuration design and artificial intelligence are identified. These include the difficulty of obtaining enough valuable data about design spaces to enable the use of artificial intelligence, the lack of a coherent probabilistic interpretation of configuration design problems, and limits to global optimizers' ability to generalize across the many possible solutions to a design problem. To address these, this work presents distinct contributions:  High-performance computing applications of hardware acceleration, modern automatic differentiation, and functionalization of conceptual design analyses that can reduce the time necessary for the evaluation by several orders of magnitude.  An adaptation of cladistic methods for phylogeny to establish an interpretable, invertible, parsimonious correspondence between configuration design and mixed-integer optimization.

{"title":"Essays on market dynamics in China's pharmaceutical and movie theater industries","abstract":"This thesis tells you all you need to know about recent policy measures undertaken by the Chinese government to enhance drug accessibility. Chapter 1 examines the competitive bidding for small-molecule generic drugs, while Chapter 2 delves into the realm of large-molecule biological drugs. The first chapter, coauthored with Shengmao Cao and Chuan Yu, studies the equilibrium effects of introducing competitive bidding in drug procurement. In 2019, China introduced a competitive bidding program where drug companies bid for a prespecified procurement quantity in nine provinces. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that the program reduced average drug prices by 47.4\\%. Generic drugs won most bids and cut prices by 75.0\\%. We develop an equilibrium model to quantify the trade-off between lower prices and potential choice distortions. Competitive bidding increases consumer welfare if policymakers believe consumers should value branded and bioequivalent generic drugs equally. The program also reduced government expenditure on insurance by 19.8\\%. The second chapter studies biological drug development decisions and analyzes the impacts of different drug regulations on market structure and consumer welfare. Specifically, we combine Chinese clinical trial and drug registration data to track firms' innovation decisions and measure consumer welfare using downstream drug sales data. We examine the trade-offs and interactions between the entry of follow-on biological drugs and social welfare. The findings suggest that follow-on products improve consumer welfare by targeting different diseases from those targeted by the original innovative drugs and by decreasing prices. We find that increasing the number of follow-on biologics would reduce the price for innovative product by 5.74\\% and would increase consumer welfare by 376.47\\%. Regulations to expedite new drug approvals by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) and to decrease entry costs would increase the entry likelihood for follow-on biologics. The most welfare-improving policy is for the state to negotiate with a single domestic firm to avoid costs from repetitive entries and simultaneously enhance consumer welfare through decreased prices. Moreover, Chapter 3, coauthored with Luming Chen and Chuan Yu, explores the welfare implications of vertical integration, with a focus on China's movie market as the contextual backdrop. Specifically, the third chapter investigates the welfare effects of vertical integration in China's movie industry. We leverage data covering all theaters and 423 popular movies in China during 2014-2018. We find no evidence of integrated movies being foreclosed to rival theaters. Integrated theaters show their movies for longer, allocate more screenings, and charge lower prices. We estimate a model of consumers' demand and theaters' screening decisions. Integrated theaters internalize a substantial fraction of their upstream companies' profits. Vertical integration both mitigates distortions from revenue-sharing contracts and steers demand favoring integrated movies.

{"title":"Waste monitoring and management for improved water quality and soil health","abstract":"Good water quality and soil health are fundamentally important to planetary (human and environmental) health, which poor waste management practises can jeopardize. Waste monitoring and management strategies can impact and influence water quality and soil health. The research in this dissertation examines these in specific contexts, with a specific focus on community needs. In so doing, it aims to contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to zero hunger, clean water and sanitation, responsible consumption and production, and life on land.  This thesis consists of three research chapters. Chapter 2 investigates fecal contamination of stored water supplies in rural Kenyan households, identifying ruminant feces as a significant source and elucidating transmission pathways. Chapter 3 explores the production of soil amendment biochar from cacao husks in Malaysia, optimizing reactor designs and characterizing biochar properties. Chapter 4 examines the impact of biochar on soil and cacao sapling growth, which demonstrated mixed results but revealed potential benefits and areas for improvement.  The findings in this dissertation underscore the importance of community-centered approaches and highlight the complexity of ensuring that waste management ultimately does remediate and ameliorate water quality and soil health. Recommendations for future research include exploring the conceptual models underpinning the research to ensure that each link of the causal chain is rigorously examined such that risks are adequately quantified, processed improved, or expenditure and effort towards interventions justified. Ultimately, the dissertation emphasizes the value of holistic, locally informed solutions to address environmental degradation and promote sustainable development. While the research presents promising avenues for enhancing water and soil quality, it underscores the need for careful consideration of unintended consequences and community perspectives in advancing sustainable development goals.","vector":[0.09789421409368515,0.005745168309658766,0.017052682116627693,0.03319913148880005,0.056464798748493195,-0.011812696233391762,-0.017014501616358757,-0.01742647960782051,-0.044857487082481384,-0.0010153019102290273,0.022557169198989868,-0.12661457061767578,-0.07752715051174164,0.04384257644414902,-0.09918805956840515,-0.06093272939324379,-0.037526682019233704,-0.000787899421993643,-0.054070696234703064,0.04399355500936508,0.060939811170101166,-0.034745678305625916,0.048920031636953354,-0.00021559273591265082,-0.06648150831460953,0.0038625777233392,0.027642657980322838,-0.04608501121401787,-0.053251445293426514,0.01372328121215105,0.03825319930911064,0.02748051844537258,0.08136656135320663,0.013124404475092888,-0.04388824850320816,0.09839548915624619,0.07279838621616364,-0.026359548792243004,0.09398757666349411,0.020427677780389786,-0.02555854432284832,-0.09879621863365173,0.06193740665912628,-0.06558503955602646,-0.012860829010605812,-0.046032242476940155,0.029317988082766533,-0.057045891880989075,-0.03294802084565163,-0.0554887093603611,0.05677594244480133,0.029053302481770515,-0.019226795062422752,0.028738589957356453,0.032252851873636246,-0.12006257474422455,0.06436787545681,-0.02643740549683571,-0.05829589441418648,-0.06257113814353943,0.020567502826452255,-0.010082719847559929,-0.02650487795472145,-0.03393677622079849,0.06336815655231476,-0.09980535507202148,-0.06709973514080048,0.09437376260757446,0.00014048878801986575,0.0050627426244318485,-0.08483263850212097,-0.02525775134563446,0.04231053218245506,0.0024678129702806473,-0.039098843932151794,0.02077862061560154,0.060822948813438416,0.051599595695734024,0.03031924180686474,0.04336067661643028,0.05003195255994797,0.03398995101451874,-0.009720646776258945,0.004498790483921766,-0.052460476756095886,-0.05581733211874962,-0.03343304619193077,0.00013799888256471604,0.019111646339297295,-0.0580693744122982,0.001562093966640532,0.035693805664777756,0.0792478546500206,-0.017758667469024658,-0.03496190905570984,-0.028332293033599854,-0.025470584630966187,-0.07065123319625854,-0.019357264041900635,-0.03889556974172592,-0.07316558063030243,0.0022322027944028378,0.03257343918085098,-0.14865240454673767,0.03345992788672447,0.03313824534416199,-0.051608454436063766,0.08240412920713425,0.1033794954419136,0.026795262470841408,-0.05889951437711716,0.009504067711532116,-0.031247610226273537,0.07871505618095398,0.046400051563978195,0.048486411571502686,-0.027261273935437202,-0.06159023195505142,-0.06478187441825867,0.00613858038559556,0.043387968093156815,-0.06681894510984421,0.011413409374654293,-0.06607633084058762,0.10607457160949707,0.002706431783735752,0.08655000478029251,1.937990700097665e-33,-0.0238833986222744,-0.05691615864634514,0.021377336233854294,-0.020668765529990196,0.035624176263809204,-0.07690495252609253,-0.053929395973682404,-0.059476740658283234,0.08853146433830261,0.005184642504900694,0.010718886740505695,-0.03755200281739235,-0.07666830718517303,0.00038513922481797636,0.0006371287163347006,-0.010153573006391525,-0.03146633505821228,-0.08351879566907883,0.048347942531108856,0.06786562502384186,0.016371972858905792,-0.04560915380716324,-0.05443541705608368,-0.039442870765924454,0.03985017538070679,-0.007089615799486637,0.044145312160253525,-0.019339067861437798,0.016958750784397125,-0.02634931541979313,0.15918180346488953,-0.003908270038664341,-0.08399340510368347,-0.07495089620351791,-0.01891225017607212,-0.056695666164159775,0.014541933313012123,0.04340539500117302,-0.03474606201052666,0.0010271144565194845,-0.06267642974853516,-0.03030921146273613,0.09605997800827026,-0.025475071743130684,0.09252265095710754,-0.031396590173244476,-0.01457140687853098,0.032499153167009354,0.04646405205130577,0.04768532142043114,0.00182788772508502,-0.029433654621243477,0.03468620777130127,0.07012244313955307,0.019922122359275818,-0.06685645878314972,0.022816423326730728,-0.09126462042331696,-0.03687387332320213,-0.01783113367855549,0.0055108149535954,-0.0034119533374905586,-0.011550131253898144,0.054927609860897064,0.015389674343168736,-0.08366211503744125,0.09286024421453476,0.08077048510313034,0.12433755397796631,0.05045453459024429,-0.0457894466817379,-0.023819204419851303,0.014681198634207249,0.041121065616607666,-0.09191297739744186,-0.03415421396493912,-0.05398412421345711,0.020173775032162666,-0.036102671176195145,0.09405176341533661,0.00028545220266096294,-0.032948192209005356,-0.023967867717146873,-0.0207025408744812,0.0015023929299786687,0.08042094111442566,-0.055345021188259125,0.04734973609447479,0.0710994154214859,0.0014319902984425426,0.016349194571375847,0.0785384476184845,-0.038452088832855225,-0.07244537770748138,-0.030087340623140335,-2.8630625098665724e-33,0.07717564702033997,0.012356319464743137,-0.03304528817534447,0.06440644711256027,0.03804909065365791,-0.0879194363951683,0.018795620650053024,-0.03470243513584137,0.051154009997844696,-0.009161124005913734,-0.048649486154317856,0.014822321012616158,0.0470748208463192,0.026617

{"title":"Flight algorithms for autonomous tracking and navigation of distributed space systems using inter-satellite bearing angles","abstract":"Immense growth in usage of the space environment renders conducting mission operations between multiple resident space objects an increasingly necessary capability. Nevertheless, the application of distributed space systems to objectives such as space domain awareness, space debris management, satellite servicing, and planetary exploration presents new demands regarding the robustness and accuracy of navigation architectures and their overall autonomy, scalability, and flexibility. These demands must be met from the dual perspectives of mission design and on-orbit implementation. In response, this research investigates optical angles-only techniques for distributed space system navigation, in which observer spacecraft obtain bearing angles of target space objects using on-board cameras. Navigation subsequently becomes self-contained within the system with equal applicability to passive versus active targets and Earth-orbiting versus deep space missions. Less advantageously, bearing angles do not provide explicit target range information and are affected by optical visibility constraints, producing challenging observability conditions with complex dependencies on state and measurement properties. As a result, there are significant gaps to be bridged between the application of individual angles-only navigation algorithms in theory, thus far limited applications of angles-only navigation in flight, and the practical application of angles-only navigation to future distributed missions. These gaps are addressed by first developing a flexible approach for analyzing angles-only system observability. A system graph topology representation is combined with analytic and numeric methods to produce robust estimates of system navigation performance which are directly relatable to mission requirements. The method is fused with an optimization framework to enable intelligent, automatic optimization of distributed space system designs for angles-only navigation. In concert, a new tracking method is developed to enable acquisition of multi-target angles-only measurements in flight, using only sequences of monocular camera images. Multi-hypothesis methods and domain-specific kinematic modeling are leveraged to produce accurate target tracks with or without a-priori target state knowledge. The tracking method is integrated with batch and sequential orbit determination algorithms to formulate a complete architecture for distributed, autonomous angles-only navigation. The architecture is extended and generalized to perform navigation for distributed space systems in highly varied formation geometries and orbit environments. Performance of the architecture is verified across a suite of high-fidelity simulations with software- and hardware-in-the-loop. Finally, the architecture is integrated as part of the NASA Starling technology demonstration mission, which intends to be the first in-flight demonstration of autonomous angles-only navigation for a spacecraft swarm. Initial flight results for single observer/single target, single observer/multi-target and multi-observer/multi-target systems display promising navigation performance in support of future distributed

{"title":"'Putting it all down, leaving it all out' : scale in post-1945 American poetry","abstract":"\"'Putting it All Down, Leaving it All Out': Scale in Post-1945 American Poetry\" offers a vision of twentieth-century American literature through the lens of \"scale, \" a formal element so basic that it is often overlooked. I analyze extremes of poetic brevity and length as complementary, distinctly postmodern responses to the increasing marginalization of poetry in the period following World War II. Like engineers subjecting a compound to extremes of heat and cold, poets -- from minimalists such as Robert Creeley and Elizabeth Bishop to maximalists such as James Merrill and Frank Stanford -- approach the limits of brevity and length as both a test of language's capacity to signify and a testament to poetry's value in exploring how language mediates experience. My approach unites an intrinsic focus on the semantics and signification of specific poems with an extrinsic attention to social pressures and historical practices. Poems that near the limit of utter silence demand to be read as bold declarations of what poetry is good for. At the opposite extreme, long poems invite the question of why, in fact, they exist as poems (rather than novels, memoirs, or plays, for example), thus enacting a similar insistence on poetry's particular relation to language. While I identify both brevity and length in the postwar period as constituting \"tests\" of poetry, I contrast how poets used the short and the long to pursue the brief, intense flash of epiphany or to evoke the rich complexity and detail of daily life. The lens of scale allows for a reconsideration of writers apart from the reified categories of schools and movements, revealing urban Beat poet Allen Ginsberg and rural Objectivist poet Lorine Niedecker's shared interest in haiku and suggesting an alternate vision of Creeley than that offered under the rubric of Charles Olson, \"Projective Verse, \" and the Black Mountain school. Among other insights, my project questions the frequent conflation of formal scale with poetic genre. In particular, I reveal the persistence of lyric and epic in the postmodern period as sources of nostalgia and as incitements for rupture with the past. In a chapter on the post-1945 haiku boom, for example, I demonstrate how poets embraced the Japanese form as a refreshing alternative to lyric inwardness. In my readings of poems by Niedecker, Jack Kerouac, and others, I theorize the divergent responses to haiku as acts of adoption, inclusion, or adaptation. A second chapter contrasts the uses of relative brevity in poems by Robert Creeley and Elizabeth Bishop as divergent approaches to poetic world-making. While both poets value the intensity of focus that a short poem offers, they envision the poetic encounter in dramatically different ways, which I conceptualize as \"immersion\" versus \"presence.\" Other chapters investigate the deliberately anti-epic approaches to domestic dailiness in feminist long poems by Lyn Hejinian and Bernadette Mayer and explore the ambivalence to epic in Merrill's \"The Changing Light at Sandover\" and Stanford's \"The Battlefield Where the Moon Says I Love You.\" Ultimately, I argue that formal extremes of both brevity and length test the limits of language's ability to signify and affirm poetry's continued significance during a period of increasing distraction and competing demands for readers' attention. Revealing scale as an essential formal element of twentieth-century verse, I analyze throughout how writers use the relationship between the space a poem occupies on the page and the space that poetry

{"title":"Soot mitigation potential of multiple injection strategies for fuel-rich combustion in compression-ignition engines","abstract":"Conventional direct-injection, compression-ignition (DI/CI) engines operate at overall lean equivalence ratios (Phi < 0.7) to avoid excessive amounts of engine-out soot emissions. In order to overcome this equivalence ratio barrier, while keeping the soot levels low, oxygenated fuels (such as methanol and ethanol) have previously shown promising results in stoichiometric DI/CI combustion strategy. Although these fuels are difficult to autoignite, utilizing thermal barrier coatings on in-cylinder surfaces have resulted in reliable operation at stoichiometric conditions while keeping the soot emissions orders of magnitude below the soot levels for Diesel fuel. Moreover, these developments have enabled the use of DI/CI engines as work-producing, fuel-reforming devices operating at fuel-rich regimes.  This work presents original data collected on single-cylinder, low-heat rejection (LHR), direct-injection, compression-ignition engine using ethanol and E85 (a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline by volume) in stoichiometric to fuel-rich equivalence ratios.   The equivalence ratio sweep data show that ethanol soot concentrations continue to increase up to an equivalence ratio of 1.4 and exhibit a plateau beyond this point. The E85 soot concentration profile shows a similar trend. However, compared to ethanol, the presence of longer chain hydrocarbon components and aromatics in the E85 increases the soot levels dramatically.  The experiments in this study focus on investigating soot mitigation potential of multiple injection strategies for ethanol in fuel-rich and E85 in stoichiometric operations. Furthermore, the effects of multiple injection strategies on engine performance and other engine-out emissions in fuel-rich and stoichiometric equivalence ratios are discussed.  Experimental findings show that it is possible to mitigate engine-out-soot by at least a factor of two without hindering the engine performance in both fuel-rich and stoichiometric DI/CI operation.  In order to be able to interpret the experimental findings, a phenomenological model referred to as Multi-Zone NSL (MZ-NSL) model for DI/CI engines was developed to capture the in-cylinder inhomogeneity and to accommodate multiple injection operating conditions. The model was able to capture the trends of exhaust species and in-cylinder pressure of multiple injection

Understanding the nature of these signals and the cells that carry them is fundamental both to understanding the visual system, and to the development of retinal prosthetic devices that restore vision. This thesis first explores the content and meaning of the retinal code, using a novel Bayesian maximum a posteriori method for reconstructing (decoding) natural images from the recorded spike trains of large populations of retinal ganglion cells. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance for reconstructing statically-presented natural images, and generalizes straightforwardly to reconstructing natural movies with emulated fixational drift eye movements, while providing an interpretable framework for understanding retinal coding. Application of the method to reconstructing natural movies demonstrates that fixational drift eye movements improve the fidelity of the retinal signal, even if the eye movements are unknown a priori and must inferred from the spike trains. Spike timing precision is found to be particularly important in the presence of eye movements, and stimulus-induced correlated firing between nearby cells is shown to contribute significantly to the content of the retinal code. Separately, this thesis develops a novel optimization-based technique to decompose the extracellularly-recorded spiking waveforms of retinal ganglion cells into distinct contributions from the somatic, dendritic, and axonal cellular compartments. This simple, biophysically-motivated representation effectively extracts physiological properties of retinal ganglion cells from their electrically-recorded waveforms, and correlates strongly with the morphology, receptive field location and structure, and functional cell type of retinal ganglion cells. This technique enables substantial advances in inferring the receptive field locations and the functional cell types of retinal ganglion cells from recorded spiking waveforms alone, addressing challenges in the calibration and operation of an epi-retinal prosthetic device.","vector":[-0.053800612688064575,-0.10956522077322006,0.08782649040222168,-0.026771387085318565,0.013163845054805279,0.03910234570503235,0.0034942422062158585,-0.06314292550086975,0.08629468083381653,0.005123043432831764,-0.01799396425485611,-0.024992842227220535,0.006119207479059696,-0.012441917322576046,-0.09543942660093307,-0.07423482835292816,0.02172742784023285,0.08680525422096252,-0.0343262255191803,-0.004192423075437546,0.11657056212425232,-0.10153155028820038,-0.006347921211272478,-0.03732152655720711,0.011876434087753296,0.04566769674420357,0.04452032968401909,0.012577079236507416,-0.014120818115770817,-0.05295432358980179,-0.011630571447312832,0.0009816151577979326,-0.08952496945858002,0.023583220317959785,-0.025312062352895737,0.05415681377053261,-0.03677089884877205,-0.050644874572753906,-0.013653512112796307,0.036128126084804535,-0.024959200993180275,0.07937750965356827,-0.0168277807533741,0.023093143478035927,0.08935853093862534,0.0493416003882885,0.06367798149585724,0.006157794501632452,-0.012879543006420135,-0.07294070720672607,-0.07723270356655121,0.0271102637052536,-0.060685694217681885,0.0025904320646077394,0.025331180542707443,0.10970627516508102,0.05050346627831459,-0.05155498534440994,0.11971806734800339,0.029630394652485847,0.020809326320886612,0.0007081451476551592,0.02302953042089939,-0.02751479670405388,-0.03766197711229324,-0.00032804644433781505,-0.019524993374943733,0.008966854773461819,0.06069321930408478,0.0026269196532666683,-0.023151680827140808,0.06444846838712692,-0.00029787933453917503,0.014487577602267265,-0.08114498108625412,-0.04563133046030998,-0.006506590638309717,0.015198864974081516,0.03570955991744995,-0.08631482720375061,0.057682134211063385,-0.03605009615421295,0.004503065720200539,0.004880919586867094,0.10926923900842667,0.047678299248218536,0.0010290095815435052,0.06579972803592682,0.04101938009262085,0.11414788663387299,-0.0788678303360939,-0.07242169231176376,-0.06196296960115433,-0.08354686200618744,0.007348287384957075,-0.02519793063402176,0.029352577403187752,-0.01740766502916813,0.09739814698696136,-0.01432846300303936,0.039644867181777954,-0.02954978682100773,0.06478067487478256,0.00899285264313221,0.021326085552573204,-0.03300991654396057,0.1040009930729866,0.055181678384542465,0.030088651925325394,0.02044660970568657,0.014558138325810432,0.024594102054834366,-0.012712297029793262,0.08511439710855484,0.026985760778188705,-0.0017560950946062803,-0.026580218225717545,0.04267958179116249,0.045215945690870285,0.0006892212550155818,0.052329305559396744,-0.050717730075120926,-0.0261367280036211,-0.028613237664103508,0.02410958893597126,-0.01792570762336254,-0.002621169202029705,2.8632158751451563e-33,0.03179370239377022,0.008944344706833363,0.0306573323905468,0.016432197764515877,0.02619274891912937,-0.02970636449754238,-0.05662418156862259,-0.024528268724679947,-0.010947606526315212,0.05553235113620758,-0.043282583355903625,-0.012420990504324436,-0.0430988073348999,0.1198820024728775,-0.0021400374826043844,-0.0206061489880085,-0.0394245944917202,0.015575761906802654,0.002155605936422944,-0.06147461012005806,-0.06402500718832016,0.022363867610692978,-0.03070713020861149,-0.08445680141448975,-0.06958358734846115,0.03509914129972458,0.041734423488378525,-0.05900431051850319,0.015124348923563957,-0.01630498841404915,-0.03204907104372978,0.0740666463971138,0.0194669421762228,-0.08566378057003021,0.04652947559952736,-0.06844376027584076,0.11752080172300339,-0.05101950839161873,0.015561230480670929,-0.037848860025405884,0.014143922366201878,0.10896077752113342,-0.035494014620780945,-0.054208409041166306,-0.027327846735715866,0.03357164189219475,0.061226971447467804,0.0986083447933197,-0.040330659598112106,0.021011367440223694,0.062244970351457596,-0.026536786928772926,0.0928211584687233,-0.08517094701528549,-0.031669970601797104,0.021902456879615784,0.00856908317655325,-0.041984621435403824,0.02207351289689541,0.010119784623384476,0.0567343533039093,0.022227829322218895,0.026649704203009605,0.0653085857629776,0.04566473886370659,0.04751843214035034,-0.00823321845382452,0.021578708663582802,0.006701993755996227,-0.023203691467642784,-0.0279147457331419,0.018016012385487556,0.00919791217893362,-0.09725659340620041,0.021503163501620293,0.04689699783921242,0.04794590175151825,0.09006264060735703,-0.06171432510018349,-0.0701538696885109,-0.09303092956542969,-0.04320967569947243,-0.04079381749033928,0.042110979557037354,0.03607815504074097,-0.005068977363407612,0.024210654199123383,-0.021696874871850014,-0.03696586191654205,-0.019490456208586693,0.034721918404102325,-0.06193999946117401,-0.00026815832825377584,-0.07073449343442917,-0.03740717098116875,-1.6265478799511153e-33,0.017819901928305626,-0.01812092773616314,0.018190087750554085,-0.035293035209178925,-0.06253636628389359,-0.07864254713058472,-0.006141424644738436,0.012063243426382542,0.05404318869113922,-0.06944825500249863,-0.10482389479875565,-0.027299992740154266,-0.06171124428510666,0.014691535383462

{"title":"DECISION-MAKING IN UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS: METRICS, SCREENING, AND MAINTENANCE","abstract":"The dissertation comprises three chapters, each functioning as a standalone paper. They are organized in the sequence of their completion. A shared theme across all chapters is the focus on improving decision-making to be more effective and reliable, especially in environments filled with data. In \"Optimal Design of North-Star Metrics\", we focus on developing more robust and better noth-start metrics. Many data-driven short-term decisions require fast-reacting metrics about their success, for example when companies run experiments to improve the targeting of their services. In these cases, the long-term outcomes of interest may not be measured in time to inform the decision, may be too sparse, or may be measured with excess noise, while available fast-reacting proxy variables may still be able to predict long-term consequences. Yet when we learn from past data which short-term proxy variables best predict some long-term outcome of interest, then turning these proxies into new north-star metrics may break their predictive power and have unintended consequences. In this chapter, we formalize the design of proxy metrics from past data as part of a statistical learning problem. Motivated by the central role of north-star metrics for the targeting of services and the optimization of platforms, we ask how to optimally leverage data about outcomes and proxy measurements over time to optimize for long-term outcomes, and how optimal choices compare to ad-hoc proxies fitted on past data. We demonstrate that leveraging proxies involves additional learning, leading to an explore--explore--exploit trade-off in finding optimal policies over time. Having established how proxy variables can be used efficiently in a dynamic learning problem, we extend our model to a dynamic principal-agent problem with misaligned preferences and private information. In this model, a principal uses a proxy metric to incentivize innovation by an agent and align short-term individual choices with the long-term goal of the organization. Similar to the case of dynamic learning, we show that learning from the short-run relationship between proxy variables and outcomes leads to biased and inefficient choices, while the optimal proxy metric can be learned by experimenting with different proxy metrics over time. The second chapter is titled \"Screening with Uncertain Preferences\". In many screening decisions and assortment optimization problems, organizations select a subset of available options for further evaluation. This includes screening job candidates in hiring and assembling consideration sets on dating and e-commerce platforms. In this chapter, we formulate, analyze, and solve a two-stage screening problem. In the first stage, a platform is presented with a large number of options, from which it must select a small subset based on limited available information about each option and the preferences over them. In the second stage, the performance of the selected options is evaluated against a decision-maker's preference, leading to the selection of the option that best fits the decision-maker's needs. We argue that the problem of selecting an initial consideration set is conceptually and computationally challenging. First, when preferences over options are uncertain, then optimizing for subsets to further consider goes beyond ranking options individually and instead requires considering their complementarity. Second, even simple instances of the initial subset-selection problem are known to be computationally hard. To solve the challenge of selecting effective consideration sets, we propose a two-step approximation algorithm that first eliminates dominated options and then selects a subset among the remaining candidates using sample average approximation. Theoretically, we show that the approximation algorithm finds the optimal subset as we increase the scenario size of an algorithm. In simulations, we further demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than alternatives based on naive heuristics, while remaining computationally feasible for realistic instances. Practically, we argue that our results have implications for the role of diversity in selection processes. It is sometimes assumed that there is a trade-off between the individual accuracy and diversity of consideration sets in selection processes such as hiring. In contrast, our results highlight a crucial insight for decision-makers: prioritizing diversity at the initial stage of the selection process is more advantageous than merely focusing on the most individually qualified candidates. The third chapter focuses on efficiency degradation and the improvement of maintenance strategies through data analysis at coal power plants in the United States, and is titled \"Efficiency Degradation and Maintenance\". In this chapter, using detailed data on hourly production, efficiency, and maintenance records from U.S. coal power plants, we examine how their efficiency decreases over time and how maintenance activities help regain this lost efficiency. Our study aims to understand these plants' wear and tear patterns and assess the effectiveness of their maintenance routines in restoring performance. By leveraging high-frequency data on output, fuel consumption, and maintenance decisions, we address the literature regarding using real-world efficiency metrics to evaluate maintenance policies. Our study employs a difference-in-differences approach to assess the efficiency of power plants pre- and post-maintenance, uncovering two key findings: a notable decline in coal power generators' efficiency leading up to maintenance and a post-maintenance efficiency improvement of approximately 1\\%. Further, we develop a theoretical maintenance model to determine the optimal maintenance strategy for plant owners, highlighting the effectiveness of a constant-control policy for stationary parameters and adapting strategies for non-stationary settings through clustering production cycles. Looking at past maintenance decisions, we have noticed a trend towards more precise scheduling. This is linked to mergers and acquisitions, which have made maintenance decisions about 30\\% more accurate.

{"title":"Enhancing machine learning with data-efficient methods","abstract":"Supervised deep learning techniques have made a tremendous and unprecedented impact in all segments of our lives, including finance, healthcare, social networks, and more. However, the progress is hindered by a substantial challenge: the dependence on large, high-quality labeled datasets. This issue is particularly acute in areas such as biomedicine, where the procurement and annotation of data are not only costly but also intricate. In response to these challenges, this thesis introduces innovative machine learning strategies that are data-efficient, aiming to reduce the dependence on extensive labeled datasets while either preserving or improving the efficacy of deep learning models.   The thesis is systematically divided into two primary sections, each targeting key aspects of data-efficient machine learning. Part I is dedicated to the development of advanced algorithms optimized for existing datasets, particularly under the constraint of limited labeling. This section introduces a novel machine learning setting for enhancing generalization and robustness in low-label scenarios, proposes an innovative open-world semi-supervised learning framework, and adapts this framework to real-world applications. Part II focuses on augmenting training resources by incorporating supplementary knowledge. It explores the integration of auxiliary tasks to enhance training, examines the use of historical data to improve AutoML search efficiency, and introduces methods for including large datasets that were previously unmanageable due to memory

{"title":"Impact of climate variability on landslide hazard in the western United States","abstract":"Landslides broadly include debris flows, rock falls, avalanches, mudslides, and any other down-gradient movement of soil, rock, or debris under the direct influence of gravity. Although landslides occur over a broad range of lithologies, climatologies, hydrological regimes, and land use types, the majority are caused by precipitation. However, for most precipitation-triggered landslides, other complex atmospheric, surface, and subsurface conditions also play a role in predisposing a slope to landslides by increasing the effects of down-gradient forces and/or reducing the strength of the underlying slope. While there is \"high confidence\" that climate change will affect landslide hazard in some regions, several limitations persist in attributing the unique influence of a climate variable — like precipitation — to a given inventory of landslides. Key challenges broadly include: the short length of the landslide record, geographic reporting bias, and the complexity of the physical system. This dissertation develops strategies for overcoming these attribution challenges, while enhancing fundamental understanding of landslide response climate variability. Chapter 1 applies panel regression with fixed effects to quantify the impact of daily, ten-day, and thirty-day precipitation accumulation on landslide hazard in urbanized and non-urbanized areas. Chapter 2 evaluates the effect of wildfire severity on precipitation-triggered landslide hazard across the western United States. In addition to developing empirical frameworks for analyzing causal relationships between land use, climate variability, and landslides, the chapters enhance fundamental understanding of landslide response to climate variability.","vector":[-0.057498686015605927,-0.02750188484787941,0.15544477105140686,0.03237910196185112,0.038347817957401276,0.007923844270408154,-0.06064503267407417,0.04853951930999756,0.053273238241672516,0.04720277339220047,-0.08195573091506958,-0.10044804960489273,0.04640910029411316,0.06848576664924622,-0.020529640838503838,0.005550749134272337,-0.008507396094501019,0.07565969973802567,-0.059906069189310074,-0.013413715176284313,0.0774526372551918,0.029077323153614998,-0.06753618270158768,0.04892389103770256,0.012634632177650928,0.0016373960534110665,-0.11837685108184814,0.0614812895655632,-0.05904550105333328,0.02553623355925083,0.007559872232377529,0.023716796189546585,-0.06265317648649216,0.05721156299114227,-0.034410495311021805,0.08077501505613327,-0.0555696003139019,0.03168638050556183,-0.030226750299334526,0.05415937304496765,-0.03375986963510513,-0.0399819053709507,0.08381768316030502,-0.028162408620119095,0.05936593562364578,-0.03260820358991623,0.056310784071683884,-0.049845319241285324,-0.08870392292737961,0.03190847858786583,0.050642505288124084,0.04615642875432968,-0.003273076144978404,0.007178188301622868,-0.09114319831132889,-0.02009965106844902,0.01722123846411705,0.012587659060955048,0.02256174013018608,-0.02127457968890667,-0.035355374217033386,-0.015009300783276558,-0.062218066304922104,-0.013249867595732212,0.0767025426030159,0.03104800172150135,-0.02315533719956875,-0.0233487356454134,0.017018739134073257,0.038079965859651566,0.013820319436490536,0.05683072656393051,0.0005009765736758709,-0.04157881438732147,0.013653959147632122,-0.06422978639602661,0.0015903320163488388,0.09428179264068604,0.006566107273101807,-0.08154526352882385,0.04706793650984764,0.14131063222885132,0.10849376767873764,-0.08082018047571182,-0.02249891124665737,-0.023008208721876144,0.08656444400548935,0.1401592344045639,0.005118002649396658,0.00993526540696621,0.0055227456614375114,-0.07230660319328308,0.05423106998205185,0.09348523616790771,-0.0051443614065647125,0.06716272234916687,-0.005163316149264574,-0.1959238052368164,0.029172122478485107,0.017993202432990074,-0.008452041074633598,-0.010084768757224083,-0.042094115167856216,0.017801053822040558,0.07491998374462128,-0.03483827784657478,-0.015497151762247086,-0.03333983197808266,-0.057517778128385544,0.10684100538492203,0.021020304411649704,-0.03326314315199852,0.06958913058042526,0.010165132582187653,0.00723491283133626,-0.0552813746035099,-0.04161238297820091,0.032618552446365356,-0.0717540755867958,-0.010051516816020012,-0.024581093341112137,-0.02869950607419014,0.024009084329009056,0.012306916527450085,0.034730877727270126,0.05000311881303787,-0.022670375183224678,9.211466688276189e-34,0.07821786403656006,-0.006981588900089264,0.035538289695978165,0.08022619783878326,0.08558891713619232,-0.08061715960502625,-0.06308533251285553,0.01474450621753931,-0.012394129298627377,0.057630717754364014,-0.029705865308642387,0.005922046490013599,-0.06625712662935257,0.02864348329603672,-0.015808064490556717,0.051976099610328674,-0.0274864062666893,0.002844175323843956,-0.058964453637599945,0.05608605220913887,-0.055528901517391205,-0.10713877528905869,0.015211398713290691,-0.000845954695250839,-0.004001610446721315,-0.007606219034641981,-0.003236189251765609,0.0907418504357338,-0.10336530953645706,-0.016870001330971718,0.060815319418907166,-0.06348343938589096,-0.007343817502260208,-0.05069922283291817,0.058766111731529236,-0.03542952239513397,-0.005454155616462231,-0.012434038333594799,0.0047632246278226376,0.018883630633354187,-0.02177869714796543,-0.021192913874983788,-0.0574728325009346,-0.031196175143122673,0.09204301983118057,-0.030201008543372154,0.10577165335416794,-0.01983998715877533,-0.035055533051490784,-0.01591118611395359,0.010007647797465324,0.08300910145044327,0.03542165830731392,-0.01300483662635088,-0.01572263240814209,0.06557881832122803,0.011698061600327492,-0.07135651260614395,0.03523707762360573,0.00031527012470178306,-0.03554908558726311,-0.008862239308655262,0.0076057882979512215,-0.059499576687812805,0.011265963315963745,-0.0043715802021324635,0.08351929485797882,0.10614627599716187,-0.042019784450531006,-0.031330741941928864,-0.008302389644086361,0.003093633335083723,-0.01634529046714306,0.04462886229157448,-0.033661872148513794,-0.014642272144556046,0.03632139787077904,-0.027003291994333267,0.07143888622522354,0.01676454022526741,-0.09646648168563843,0.029335061088204384,0.029275676235556602,-0.019956855103373528,-0.026349330320954323,0.04704735055565834,0.04689597338438034,-0.02416965179145336,-0.00025010955869220197,0.019682608544826508,-0.09178102761507034,-0.015582993626594543,-0.018736474215984344,-0.02590472623705864,0.03326893597841263,-2.0508412801834738e-33,-0.08150387555360794,0.021313847973942757,-0.06785373389720917,-0.012337184511125088,-0.011017409153282642,-0.00515790656208992,-0.04007454589009285,-0.034843362867832184,0.06746263056993484,-0.03031213954091072,-0.10218428820371628,0.02002805471420288,0.026662347838282585

{"title":"Probabilistic assessment of pore pressure prediction with Bayesian Geophysical Basin Modeling","abstract":"Effective decision-making in exploring and developing subsurface resources hinges on accurately estimating geologically plausible and realistic properties. Nevertheless, conventional inverse modeling formulations for property estimation encounter computational challenges arising from high-dimensional problem settings and the substantial geological uncertainty inherent in subsurface estimation problems. Especially for pore pressure forecast, this challenge yields to disregarding the geological processes occurring in the subsurface in the predictions by standardizing the use of empirical models calibrated only on offset wells. This dissertation introduces and investigates methodologies rooted in the Bayesian Geophysical Basin Modeling (BGBM) workflow to assess pore pressure. The aim is to incorporate geological processes into estimations and utilize probabilistic models, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of pore pressure predictions across exploration and exploitation stages in subsurface resource

{"title":"Convex shape optimization of aerospace vehicles","abstract":"The field of aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) has seen dramatic advances in the last several decades through major developments in computational power and numerical methods. Today, the process of gradient-based optimization of complex, three-dimensional aerospace vehicles, using high-fidelity physical models, is mature.  This dissertation explores a new horizon of shape optimization for aerospace vehicles, employing techniques from the field of convex optimization. Unlike traditional nonconvex, gradient-based optimization techniques, which iteratively refine an initial design towards a new local optimum, convex optimization seeks a globally optimal solution.   These techniques address two important open problems in ASO. The first is the need to be able to efficiently and robustly explore high dimensional, constrained, multi-objective design spaces in order to assess performance tradeoffs and limits during the initial development of new vehicles. The second problem is linking these exploratory, or conceptual design, studies to the high-fidelity, gradient-based optimization frameworks for final refinement. These frameworks require a parameterization and an initial design point. Good parameterizations and initial design points can significantly decrease the overhead of these computationally expensive processes. Convex optimization offers an exciting avenue to addressing both of these problems.   In the first part of this dissertation, I develop a framework called Convexity Assisted Shape Optimization, or CASO. CASO provides a set of rules and requirements for approaching aerospace vehicle shape optimization problems through the lens of convex optimization. I also propose two new types of smooth and accurate convex surrogates that will be useful in reducing this framework to practice.  In the second part of this dissertation, I propose several new classes of orthogonal basis functions for parameterizing shapes in aerodynamic shape optimization problems. In some cases, these bases simplify the derivation and expression of useful aerodynamic objective functions. In other cases they offer a natural path to representing important aspects of aerodynamic shapes. I also show how these bases can be used to develop convex formulations of several common aerodynamic performance indicators, spanning multiple flow regimes.  In the third part, I extend these methods to nonconvex objective functions that have convex trust regions that may be represented accurately and smoothly using convex surrogates. I also consider the cases of nonconvex objective functions that benefit from a transformation and relaxation strategy or a bi-level optimization scheme to preserve the ability to identify a global optimum.   Finally, I show how these methods can be applied to actual design problems and link these conceptual results to a high-fidelity design framework.

{"title":"From satellites to stomata : measuring and modeling vegetation responses to water stress at ecosystem scale","abstract":"The response of plants to water stress is a first-order control on the water and carbon cycles, and plays a key role in wildfire, crop productivity, and forest mortality. While water stress response has been studied extensively in individual plants, ecosystem-scale data and models are largely missing, limiting our ability to understand plant water stress effects at large spatial scales. This dissertation helps address that gap. In Chapter 2, I present the first field experiment directly testing the sensitivity of microwave radiometry (a type of remote sensing) to plant water potential in a forest. I show that vegetation optical depth derived from radiometry mirrors diurnal and seasonal changes in tree leaf water potential. In Chapter 3, I use a simulation experiment to investigate how plant traits describing water stress response could be estimated with microwave radiometry from satellites in various orbits combined with a land surface model. Encouragingly, using two satellites similar to those already in Sun-synchronous orbits yields similar accuracy to using a geostationary satellite observing at all hours of the day, which has been proposed but would be much more expensive in practice. In Chapter 4, I focus on one key mechanism of water stress: the closing and opening of stomata on plant leaves. I introduce a new model of stomatal response to water stress, I empirically estimate the time scales that stomatal responses to water stress appear to be optimized for in a range of ecosystems, and I relate those time scales to ecosystem climate characteristics. Overall, the results presented in my dissertation can help see the forest for the trees - that is, help understand how water stress affects entire ecosystems. In the future, this work could be extended to predict vegetation responses to the increased stresses of climate change and identify hot spots of vulnerability or resilience, among other applications.","vector":[0.021367358043789864,-0.029468633234500885,0.03479582071304321,0.05448072776198387,0.08997417986392975,-0.058843351900577545,-0.007207371294498444,-0.007911432534456253,0.05429938808083534,0.06275863200426102,-0.056334469467401505,-0.09540653228759766,-0.01610073447227478,-0.0027125137858092785,0.01672985404729843,-0.08054819703102112,-0.08595481514930725,0.01046791672706604,-0.05684904754161835,-0.033607181161642075,0.04045558720827103,0.03091278299689293,-0.0657229796051979,-0.058374445885419846,0.05877560377120972,-0.06551912426948547,-0.0809512808918953,0.04531275853514671,-0.04842807352542877,0.007438693195581436,0.03889692574739456,0.06371382623910904,0.01586875692009926,-0.004794349893927574,-0.034060340374708176,0.05488906055688858,0.052054621279239655,-0.17764580249786377,-0.02318025752902031,0.013519483618438244,-0.021760448813438416,-0.05826166644692421,0.05922549217939377,0.017799824476242065,-0.10106541216373444,0.010192829184234142,0.014451714232563972,0.005794016644358635,-0.0817587748169899,-0.04700469225645065,0.00987812876701355,-0.05332399159669876,-0.0894341841340065,0.02524697408080101,-0.030151372775435448,-0.06103644520044327,0.0530608631670475,-0.02148568257689476,0.04920516535639763,-0.002005306538194418,0.06906363368034363,-0.012858273461461067,-0.09635233879089355,0.005521635990589857,0.07515902817249298,0.04433991014957428,-0.14481070637702942,0.0001751240051817149,0.06221272796392441,-0.046284813433885574,-0.08230302482843399,0.04852009564638138,0.021800965070724487,-0.06650037318468094,-0.05701690539717674,-0.03787345811724663,-0.01870999112725258,0.08231893926858902,0.06026134267449379,-0.052255187183618546,0.05729896202683449,0.008873851969838142,-0.04367869347333908,0.013338656164705753,-0.009660335257649422,0.025648359209299088,0.007003874983638525,0.037956804037094116,0.03293274715542793,-0.03455687314271927,0.07569722086191177,-0.016570299863815308,-0.09113888442516327,0.09553798288106918,-0.06411802023649216,0.10574190318584442,0.12059424072504044,-0.12019233405590057,0.011860964819788933,-0.0071372538805007935,-0.01178592350333929,-0.034599773585796356,-0.002698480151593685,0.07522697001695633,0.04485683888196945,-0.09659022092819214,-0.044370535761117935,0.017048299312591553,0.02582276239991188,-0.026709631085395813,-0.06531762331724167,0.059366434812545776,-0.08064326643943787,0.04507400467991829,-0.038505375385284424,0.002945762360468507,0.0022109518758952618,-0.008176886476576328,0.010190865024924278,-0.014916281215846539,-0.01642037369310856,-0.019868874922394753,-0.059662748128175735,0.005340705160051584,0.13719208538532257,0.030674884095788002,0.00544231291860342,3.203630590277644e-33,0.05092631280422211,0.05251190438866615,-0.014541403390467167,-0.033400654792785645,0.03608212620019913,-0.07430590689182281,-0.0818295031785965,-0.02299741469323635,-0.013432852923870087,0.013006649911403656,-0.06197761371731758,0.019632551819086075,-0.08965568244457245,-0.05487107113003731,0.029660334810614586,0.05872576683759689,-0.039817214012145996,0.05240784212946892,-0.002541196532547474,0.06817285716533661,-0.020732952281832695,-0.05541837960481644,-0.04154229536652565,-0.007559848949313164,0.06452947854995728,-0.02879483811557293,0.05510932207107544,0.010910551063716412,0.00789029523730278,-0.0035517686046659946,0.04776078462600708,-0.02006278932094574,-0.00805637426674366,0.05058681219816208,0.030513647943735123,-0.04086236655712128,0.03208479285240173,0.0006342469132505357,0.030379481613636017,0.03922569751739502,0.01658211275935173,0.07418099790811539,0.025475140661001205,0.0249902606010437,0.06035527214407921,-0.03958120942115784,0.021084321662783623,-0.012581029906868935,0.04834878817200661,0.05834916979074478,-0.002817244967445731,0.0533074326813221,-0.013820112682878971,-0.024130936712026596,0.013715183362364769,0.023603525012731552,0.07364796102046967,0.0030959444120526314,-0.07009794563055038,0.07495938986539841,-0.035809148102998734,-0.08545871824026108,0.06097491830587387,-0.06642745435237885,0.07687912881374359,0.0448075570166111,-0.031763240694999695,0.04980137571692467,0.023001836612820625,0.028443269431591034,-0.06104780733585358,-0.033174604177474976,0.022317100316286087,-0.029093163087964058,-0.013980555348098278,0.022197462618350983,0.06099432334303856,0.0430171862244606,-0.052327461540699005,0.05790122598409653,0.02237938530743122,0.008865383453667164,-0.0005091821658425033,-0.017237350344657898,-0.09849193692207336,-0.02429555356502533,-0.05293726176023483,-0.09676641970872879,-0.03958865627646446,0.010106036439538002,0.04529254510998726,0.09739518165588379,0.01139580737799406,-0.0836176946759224,0.023368138819932938,-3.4411432646231183e-33,-0.004769184626638889,-0.053046759217977524,0.013494856655597687,0.05483485385775566,0.040723007172346115,-0.029694002121686935,-0.04746726527810097,0.003207266563549638,-0.031381916254758835,0.004246008116751909,0.01921965181827545,0.08873003721237183,-0.11113342642784119,0.014441296458244324

{"title":"Essays in political economy : status perceptions and survey experiments","abstract":"This dissertation contains three chapters each of which addresses topics related to status perceptions and survey experiments. The first chapter provides a new theory that clarifies the mechanism through which low perceptions of subjective status can lead to increased support for populist and populist-right candidates. The second chapter is the experimental extension of the first chapter, and it implements a survey experiment with a treatment that induces respondents to hold lower perceptions of their socioeconomic status. The last chapter is a methodological investigation of adaptive algorithms' relative performance in efficiently identifying the best arm compared to uniform randomization, the most widely adopted experimental design in social science, in a setting with multiple treatments and a limited budget.","vector":[-0.0028928504325449467,0.010112267918884754,0.00532679446041584,0.020251192152500153,0.033640943467617035,-0.041017044335603714,-0.004518338479101658,0.050476428121328354,-0.06692075729370117,0.027918996289372444,-0.0075049311853945255,-0.004993676673620939,0.05514313653111458,-0.10981646180152893,-0.019074169918894768,-0.015644842758774757,0.08450043946504593,0.00428971229121089,0.010267084464430809,0.005481889471411705,-0.1253785938024521,-0.04146265611052513,0.04765043407678604,0.022184031084179878,0.007578443735837936,-0.052319422364234924,0.02066168189048767,-0.043076835572719574,0.021710680797696114,0.05406591668725014,0.06445948034524918,0.03455379605293274,0.03265896812081337,-0.027534516528248787,-0.05228642746806145,-0.05547016113996506,0.040758002549409866,-0.046863000839948654,0.011536437086760998,0.012319780886173248,-0.049687400460243225,-0.04298919066786766,-0.051166415214538574,-0.10845084488391876,0.038871169090270996,0.0681573674082756,0.02612186409533024,0.011847087182104588,-0.04507597163319588,0.026867814362049103,-0.0766385942697525,-0.037296194583177567,0.025280430912971497,-0.05200602114200592,0.014151733368635178,-0.004987148568034172,0.01337812002748251,0.012741475366055965,0.022918909788131714,0.03247067704796791,-0.03060832805931568,-0.04880433529615402,-0.020808303728699684,-0.009104151278734207,0.014360462315380573,0.013578769750893116,-0.02879905328154564,-0.006374838296324015,-0.04958934709429741,0.016218600794672966,0.05607670545578003,0.07629592716693878,-0.034800924360752106,-0.013115467503666878,0.022079024463891983,-0.035267915576696396,-0.0260834451764822,0.0706176832318306,0.04825075343251228,-0.008244478143751621,0.029101410880684853,-0.08297765254974365,-0.046305932104587555,0.011117875576019287,0.04655701667070389,-0.12091316282749176,-0.029700638726353645,-0.052705757319927216,0.0453985221683979,-0.04089220240712166,-0.0031710693147033453,0.09066815674304962,-0.03456030413508415,-0.0050110165029764175,-0.02060454897582531,0.00369824655354023,0.043734677135944366,-0.027652783319354057,0.007283713202923536,0.12548793852329254,-0.04312945529818535,-0.004075187724083662,0.009729290381073952,0.008205289021134377,0.009093954227864742,-0.024479921907186508,-0.0030293744057416916,-0.03280128166079521,0.03443359583616257,-0.02448836714029312,-0.05231601744890213,-0.020174318924546242,0.02491738088428974,-0.00586720323190093,-0.04042050987482071,-0.15867729485034943,0.04108843579888344,0.026088103652000427,-0.0661596953868866,0.05450470373034477,0.065680131316185,-0.047106072306632996,0.01467282697558403,-0.07663775235414505,0.12225398421287537,0.028270266950130463,-0.07242101430892944,-1.3333426709865813e-33,0.015408884733915329,-0.013845380395650864,0.020214367657899857,0.008678585290908813,-0.06107459217309952,0.013701051473617554,-0.02546665631234646,-0.051297206431627274,0.02065827138721943,-0.01619056984782219,0.06586934626102448,0.06184356287121773,-0.0017521874979138374,0.10475185513496399,0.0723356083035469,-0.09177880734205246,-0.003399068955332041,0.08367867022752762,-0.05580562353134155,0.00973387248814106,0.034151118248701096,0.023689663037657738,0.038729310035705566,-0.09070444852113724,0.04105663672089577,0.033399954438209534,0.0173827912658453,-0.02391582913696766,-0.022150840610265732,-0.005338701419532299,0.04396158456802368,0.034387193620204926,-0.000421279517468065,-0.0859990119934082,-0.0016016592271625996,-0.04848017171025276,0.024679873138666153,0.014629654586315155,-0.00486512528732419,-0.01575404219329357,-0.07448868453502655,0.016022225841879845,0.08409497141838074,0.046027638018131256,0.009635078720748425,0.06195617467164993,0.05148962512612343,-0.00921570509672165,0.03402811288833618,-0.029078945517539978,0.029827486723661423,-0.01640566624701023,0.0053488714620471,-0.03647154942154884,-0.053888361901044846,-0.0275947917252779,-0.11315737664699554,0.012944013811647892,-0.06564156711101532,-0.09839008003473282,0.02217620052397251,-0.025576448068022728,-0.047252073884010315,-0.053990766406059265,-0.0056574963964521885,0.10667650401592255,-0.03928868845105171,-0.0619061179459095,0.11288484185934067,0.0423799604177475,0.0566696859896183,0.024308929219841957,-0.14655040204524994,0.03412744030356407,-0.061043500900268555,0.03262850642204285,0.030065104365348816,0.021192265674471855,-0.02005784772336483,-0.11088491231203079,0.03522348403930664,-0.05198707804083824,-0.005304917227476835,-0.10782136023044586,0.11503799259662628,0.02208329364657402,0.06128629297018051,-0.04637984558939934,0.06551028043031693,-0.03483104705810547,-0.06087605655193329,0.007888463325798512,-0.03748653456568718,0.06621932983398438,-0.052774857729673386,-2.522267412108998e-33,-0.10784061998128891,-0.08526817709207535,-0.01209226530045271,0.11075074225664139,0.06026575341820717,0.02899537980556488,-0.016741741448640823,-0.1303493231534958,0.028509274125099182,0.042602572590112686,-0.08800781518220901,-0.030648425221443176,0.08675652742385864,0.01896492578089237

{"title":"Higher-order approximation manifolds for more efficient nonlinear projection-based model order reduction","abstract":"Solving large-scale parameterized dynamical systems, which may be obtained through, for example, the discretization of partial differential equations, is foundationally important to many fields, including engineering. Oftentimes, these high-dimensional models are expensive to evaluate due, in part, to their large size; this expense may be exacerbated by repeated evaluations in a large-dimensional parameter space. Projection-based model order reduction is a framework that allows us to solve these high-dimensional models at a much lower cost in terms of computational resources. This is accomplished by collecting prior solutions associated with different parameter values obtained by exercising the high-dimensional model and forming a lower-dimensional subspace. Using this subspace, we can compute a new solution associated with an unsampled parameter value at (ideally) a much lower cost. This computational efficiency has significant implications for applications in simulation-driven design, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification, among others, all of which would be impractical, if not impossible, for truly large-scale problems without resorting to some form of surrogate modeling. In practice, however, projection-based reduced order models sometimes struggle to achieve this level of performance in problems that exhibit the well-known Kolmogorov barrier as is often encountered in first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations, e.g., Navier-Stokes equations.  This dissertation presents dimension reduction techniques, the problem of the Kolmogorov barrier, why it remains a challenge for model reduction today, and discusses methods to solve it. Among these methods are two novel approaches presented in this dissertation: a data-driven quadratic approximation manifold as well as an arbitrarily nonlinear approximation manifold using artificial neural networks. With no sacrifice in accuracy, both achieve an order of magnitude improvement in wall clock time compared to the current state-of-the-art in projection-based model order reduction for industrial-grade flow problems.","vector":[-0.026604492217302322,0.004421514924615622,0.08022432029247284,0.007945223711431026,0.02207682840526104,0.004936976358294487,-0.05426379665732384,0.015768082812428474,0.07215630263090134,0.015830129384994507,-0.015397034585475922,0.03685354068875313,0.008833114989101887,-0.003610833315178752,-0.0794377326965332,-0.029094068333506584,0.0024354271590709686,0.07704747468233109,-0.09477173537015915,-0.0019435827853158116,0.03454447537660599,0.025585511699318886,-0.03514081612229347,0.011897576041519642,0.04478085786104202,-0.038338884711265564,0.06326914578676224,0.017071794718503952,-0.019860533997416496,-0.012538106180727482,0.01572657749056816,0.02021130546927452,-0.04687244072556496,-0.09088286012411118,-0.019815124571323395,-0.002900079358369112,0.01876136288046837,-0.024946747347712517,0.0022658896632492542,0.02438683807849884,0.0265415720641613,0.08765377849340439,0.03596554696559906,0.005005805287510157,0.07475026696920395,-0.03968701884150505,0.035023439675569534,-0.046250782907009125,-0.013494713231921196,-0.0671098604798317,-0.03158723562955856,-0.0006276779458858073,-0.0056709228083491325,0.020444968715310097,0.037492282688617706,-0.10920140892267227,0.006776043213903904,-0.0499553419649601,0.020102741196751595,0.02102719247341156,-0.09200463443994522,-0.038586802780628204,-0.006857673171907663,-0.006922313477844,-0.007227328140288591,0.019337240606546402,0.05637911334633827,0.04804765060544014,-0.020362552255392075,0.10981737077236176,-0.08159761130809784,0.04240058735013008,0.03490487486124039,0.020232345908880234,0.05413787439465523,-0.02819354273378849,0.08383923768997192,0.020746566355228424,0.024208173155784607,-0.009560929611325264,0.0898490697145462,0.02100204862654209,-0.13387629389762878,-0.06289608776569366,0.021948162466287613,0.00037997608887962997,-0.07924463599920273,0.0039816261269152164,0.15828128159046173,-0.03537890315055847,0.019536204636096954,-0.03612329065799713,-0.04828706011176109,0.010422359220683575,0.00523121515288949,-0.0608571358025074,0.109032042324543,-0.014721965417265892,0.022801473736763,0.06865265220403671,0.010311716236174107,0.02036827616393566,0.06257616728544235,0.05439737066626549,0.06989104300737381,-0.06414848566055298,-0.0038664350286126137,0.09263899177312851,-0.067961685359478,-0.047563586384058,0.03020014800131321,-0.05415314808487892,-0.01596459373831749,0.08751731365919113,0.05400820076465607,-0.08975629508495331,0.11965769529342651,-0.07829762250185013,0.027825145050883293,-0.062278881669044495,-0.012497369199991226,-0.05997130647301674,0.09492958337068558,0.05997812747955322,-0.005095214117318392,0.028525004163384438,-0.08066680282354355,3.091921892751064e-33,0.018775640055537224,0.07096987962722778,0.07881280779838562,0.026129955425858498,0.027532678097486496,0.0205279141664505,0.06827180832624435,0.08399446308612823,-0.01766096241772175,0.03347035497426987,-0.0672367662191391,0.02433427982032299,-0.06934374570846558,0.02818572334945202,0.079123355448246,-0.01740967109799385,0.010616433806717396,0.12426502257585526,-0.06763239204883575,-0.01184400450438261,0.05895926058292389,-0.03897819668054581,-0.05871487781405449,-0.03225509822368622,-0.014000431634485722,-0.05231838673353195,-0.003982318099588156,-0.0050377631559967995,-0.07682706415653229,-0.008226972073316574,-0.06297685205936432,-0.04035796597599983,-0.016926148906350136,0.08973611891269684,-0.013586053624749184,0.01651218719780445,-0.007529383059591055,-0.01597842201590538,-0.0077117616310715675,-0.032332926988601685,-0.002562556881457567,0.006378710735589266,0.02230929397046566,0.06645475327968597,-0.10327685624361038,-0.0868719294667244,-0.0015564349014312029,0.011737137101590633,-0.026976659893989563,-0.04650210589170456,-0.0308808796107769,0.025768935680389404,0.019978035241365433,-0.0679694414138794,-0.0985521450638771,-0.07711432874202728,0.06701836735010147,-0.059237342327833176,-0.0046999454498291016,0.07008083164691925,-0.10946004092693329,-0.023387040942907333,-0.029750250279903412,0.01891142502427101,0.07329555600881577,-0.013081243261694908,-0.03699062019586563,-0.030532069504261017,0.05738457292318344,-0.03829053044319153,-0.030937720090150833,0.0036699336487799883,0.04568697139620781,-0.05427013337612152,0.13813136518001556,-0.06111551821231842,0.02772667072713375,0.021864518523216248,-0.038635071367025375,-0.04150982201099396,-0.018969768658280373,0.08467741310596466,-0.046468060463666916,0.016756366938352585,0.043179791420698166,-0.03809754177927971,-0.007399544585496187,0.01093211118131876,-0.061584532260894775,-0.13060177862644196,-0.10577123612165451,0.002508843783289194,-0.02484860271215439,-0.01751357689499855,0.03475423529744148,-2.3801832058732004e-33,0.02576708234846592,0.023873155936598778,0.05140610411763191,0.008086886256933212,-0.01655367575585842,-0.09462672472000122,-0.01574796438217163,-0.008484864607453346,-0.03610248118638992,-0.1436077356338501,-0.03570626676082611,-0.04232826083898544,0.04734927415847778,0.05491723492741585,0.08366215

In turbulent flows, direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the governing equations is often intractable due to the wide range of scales that must be resolved. Instead, turbulence modeling approaches, such as Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, are widely-used in engineering applications. RANS models compute averaged quantities, such as the mean velocities needed for the prediction of drag or lift on an aircraft, that are sufficient for many engineering applications.   Widely-used RANS models rely on a local and isotropic eddy viscosity approximation that is inadequate for complex flows. This work begins by revisiting an existing framework for incorporating nonlocal and anisotropic effects, namely Reynolds stress transport models. While we include recent experimental/DNS data from literature with the goal of improving model accuracy and develop an analytical near-wall model for capturing the leading-order behavior of all components of the Reynolds stresses near the wall, we encounter substantial challenges in making model improvements, particularly due to the distinct model requirements for both near-wall, low turbulent intensity regions, and away-from-wall, high turbulent intensity regions. This motivates both the development of an alternative modeling approach and a physical investigation of nonlocal and anisotropic effects in turbulent wall-bounded flows, which are the focuses of the rest of this work.  The macroscopic forcing method (MFM) of Mani and Park (2021) allows computation of the exact nonlocal and anisotropic eddy viscosity. However, to compute the exact eddy viscosity, a brute force application of MFM requires as many DNSs as degrees of freedom in the averaged space. We develop a systematic and cost-effective approach for quantifying and modeling the nonlocal eddy viscosity that needs only information about a few of the low-order eddy viscosity moments, which can be computed efficiently using only one simulation per moment. The resulting model form, using what we call matched moment inverse operators, closely approximates the shape of the true nonlocal eddy viscosity kernel and is in the form of a partial differential equation rather than a difficult to solve integro-partial differential equation.   We then focus on a physical investigation of the exact nonlocal and anisotropic eddy viscosity in turbulent wall-bounded flows. To alleviate the computational cost of a brute force MFM approach, we develop an adjoint-based macroscopic forcing method (adjoint MFM) for targeted computation of the nonlocal eddy viscosity, which relates the Reynolds stresses at a given location to the mean velocity gradient at all points in space, using only one simulation per desired location. While prior works have examined the wall-normal nonlocal eddy viscosity in turbulent channel flow, we use adjoint MFM to examine the streamwise and wall-normal nonlocal eddy viscosity in turbulent channel flow at select near-wall

{"title":"Rewriting the mammalian genome : a user's guide","abstract":"In this dissertation, I embark on an explorative journey to unravel the complexities and unlock the potential of \"rewriting the mammalian genome.\" This odyssey commences with a philosophical reflection on the questions that first inspired me towards this pursuit and an exploration of the current landscape of site-specific engineering technologies, tracing both their origins and evolution (Chapter 1). This is followed by an examination of the successes and challenges I have encountered in trying to apply these tools to \"rewrite the mammalian genome\" both ex vivo (Chapter 2) and in vivo (Chapter 3). Leveraging insights I have gained from my experience with both approaches, I amalgamate them into something new (Chapter 4). Along the way I also outline hurdles posed by both innate cellular (Chapter 2) and adaptive immune systems (Chapter 5) to \"rewriting the mammalian genome\" as well as potential avenues to overcome them. Finally, the narrative culminates in a distillation of the work I have performed and the lessons I have learned along the way to outline a comprehensive framework by which I believe \"rewriting of the mammalian genome\" can be achieved (Chapter 6). The dissertation encapsulates work conducted across various fields, emphasizing the lessons I have learned in my endeavor to \"rewrite the mammalian genome.\" It offers reflections and insights into the complexities, challenges, and triumphs encountered in my quest to push the frontiers of genetic engineering in mammals, charting a course to fully realize the immense potential that \"rewriting of the mammalian genome\" holds.","vector":[-0.13382664322853088,0.013908274471759796,0.04620964825153351,-0.011280843988060951,0.02931254170835018,-0.017422031611204147,0.006764733698219061,-0.007693774066865444,-0.06778068095445633,0.03465498983860016,-0.07811522483825684,-0.011555517092347145,-0.06339041143655777,-0.00011613796959863976,-0.035724859684705734,0.05234888568520546,-0.053446557372808456,0.08858658373355865,0.018918123096227646,0.03677589073777199,-0.010063998401165009,0.05662980303168297,0.03324056416749954,0.009767632000148296,-0.06725841015577316,-0.04337849095463753,-0.007458947133272886,0.013752182945609093,-0.03458942845463753,-0.052201271057128906,0.04021367058157921,0.05623573064804077,-0.038362495601177216,-0.01808401197195053,0.02476273477077484,0.03927207738161087,-0.023086581379175186,0.027101466432213783,0.03228575363755226,-0.05887410789728165,0.05145133286714554,-0.10529515147209167,-0.08463463187217712,0.027276111766695976,0.05737951397895813,-0.030545014888048172,0.018221097066998482,-0.03441555052995682,9.538666199659929e-05,0.030997134745121002,-0.0651407465338707,-0.015894971787929535,-0.12024518102407455,0.025256363674998283,-0.056098394095897675,0.03929378464818001,-0.0255864430218935,-0.005063345655798912,0.004084095358848572,-0.027291424572467804,0.03174815699458122,-0.005641234572976828,-0.03738808631896973,0.03726663812994957,0.02718241699039936,-0.04640994593501091,0.020822182297706604,0.021908465772867203,-0.015188765712082386,0.0431603342294693,-0.006301704328507185,0.03668934479355812,-0.041571274399757385,0.006036218721419573,0.017130548134446144,0.04686596617102623,-0.010344580747187138,0.04959898069500923,0.03124687634408474,-0.0538509301841259,0.06671933084726334,-0.004916226491332054,0.05420071259140968,0.039362356066703796,-0.023390043526887894,-0.00047688622726127505,-0.02694423496723175,-0.03027006983757019,0.033897437155246735,-0.0038888873532414436,-0.06054653599858284,-0.10054142028093338,0.08665795624256134,0.0034901367034763098,0.032470256090164185,0.07315278798341751,0.014635859988629818,-0.007180331274867058,0.03476148098707199,0.05684828385710716,-0.027957996353507042,-0.0164317823946476,-0.03690733760595322,-0.043134842067956924,0.004547730088233948,-0.047350503504276276,-0.023875456303358078,0.05607151240110397,-0.004080513026565313,0.04326918348670006,0.01219161506742239,0.05247558653354645,-0.00780452461913228,0.049104075878858566,0.06380917131900787,-0.0290002953261137,-0.0029394926968961954,-0.026114463806152344,0.08177144080400467,0.01225693617016077,0.018430860713124275,0.03463262692093849,-0.01692986860871315,-0.012340528890490532,-0.012173115275800228,-0.01661064103245735,0.050122350454330444,2.0517276763923907e-33,-0.02501058019697666,0.042542099952697754,0.03920874744653702,0.08274488151073456,0.02881186082959175,-0.009289124049246311,0.011775348335504532,-0.05046242102980614,-0.06734310835599899,0.046451784670352936,-0.04784610494971275,0.03682062029838562,0.025603847578167915,0.13144949078559875,-0.018835075199604034,-0.07429278641939163,-0.09939239919185638,-0.005238385405391455,0.08104132860898972,-0.001253177528269589,-0.0060478257946670055,0.030825510621070862,-4.397063094074838e-05,-0.06901109218597412,-0.017383284866809845,-0.032745134085416794,-0.059304215013980865,-0.03014843538403511,-0.032607339322566986,0.0006822983850724995,-0.0842117965221405,0.06470351666212082,-0.03567755967378616,0.026550857350230217,-0.03529876098036766,-0.03801962360739708,0.11623216420412064,-0.16676102578639984,0.03467854857444763,0.046770788729190826,-0.033062513917684555,0.04078475013375282,-0.04256986081600189,-0.08758734166622162,0.08906600624322891,0.007833486422896385,0.012927583418786526,-0.01383750606328249,-0.03560824692249298,-0.004975974094122648,0.02694016322493553,0.01702597551047802,0.048676375299692154,-0.06097540631890297,-0.018799440935254097,-0.10582497715950012,-0.08963416516780853,-0.0018676294712349772,-0.0315806083381176,0.05123338848352432,0.010978085920214653,0.02159959077835083,-0.07751307636499405,0.043553635478019714,0.04967210069298744,-0.04133358225226402,0.010746722109615803,-0.03401555120944977,0.028316110372543335,-0.026976993307471275,-0.01120510883629322,-0.0682108998298645,0.022224459797143936,-0.07901745289564133,-0.0029567854944616556,-0.008682988584041595,0.018587136641144753,0.11358904093503952,-0.0761512964963913,-0.009850500151515007,0.002984090009704232,0.09331271797418594,-0.12105150520801544,0.06536384671926498,0.0036894301883876324,-0.04660739004611969,0.07513286173343658,-0.0812917947769165,-0.022573688998818398,-0.037469375878572464,0.07006353884935379,-0.05862586200237274,-0.03445252776145935,-0.02228907123208046,0.0107203284278512,-6.0774295880000474e-33,0.02723267488181591,-0.04307996854186058,-0.01647302322089672,-0.019792040809988976,-0.03170229494571686,0.010256805457174778,-0.039566218852996826,-0.006454862654209137,-0.026818513870239258,-0.04865002632141113,-0.020679442211985588,-0.02864840440452099,0.01651242934167385

{"title":"Wavefunction-based simulations : dynamics of quantum many-body systems","abstract":"Many exotic phases of matter, such as quantum spin liquid (QSL) and high temperature superconductivity, are associated with strong correlations between constituent particles. Yet theoretical analysis is largely hindered by the strong interactions. Numeric simulations, although facing the challenge of exponential complexity, have provided valuable theoretical insights and connections to experiments. In this work, I present wavefunction-based numerical methods to study strongly correlated systems with an emphasis on dynamics, which can provide extra information about the excitations in the system, connect theoretical modeling with experimental spectroscopies and can reveal interactions in the system. After an overview, I will first discuss characterizations of the QSL on a triangular lattice through dynamical spin structure factor and Raman scattering. The QSL phase shows distinct spectral features, among which a prominent chiral excitation in Raman spectra signals proximity to chiral ordering. I then present the study of salient spectral features observed in recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiment on a one-dimensional cuprate. These spectral features can be well reproduced by adding extended electron-phonon couplings, which enhances superconducting pairing correlations in 1D and may help the establishment of superconductivity in 2D. Finally, I present a time-dependent nonequilibrium study and show cuprates superconductivity could potentially be enhanced via laser driven photodoping. I conclude with some ideas to go beyond the results presented in this thesis.","vector":[-0.08388755470514297,-0.08722922205924988,-0.04400644823908806,0.05518573522567749,0.031059417873620987,0.07513117790222168,-0.006436139810830355,-0.03215734288096428,0.005024370737373829,-0.03676266968250275,0.03203653544187546,-0.006275326479226351,-0.03373264521360397,0.06445597112178802,0.07260361313819885,-0.009191515855491161,0.0615987554192543,-0.011843296699225903,-0.04241235554218292,0.02100178971886635,0.002842624904587865,-0.1394026130437851,0.028824619948863983,-0.028430573642253876,0.04348510503768921,0.04763849452137947,0.05509079992771149,-0.021327778697013855,-0.016121437773108482,0.006597390864044428,0.10011749714612961,0.08125465363264084,-0.10964275151491165,0.014663551934063435,-0.006822099443525076,0.040783073753118515,0.08513087779283524,-0.046561744064092636,0.0062946053221821785,-0.11165817826986313,0.08607359230518341,0.05460137873888016,0.01156904362142086,-0.02438022941350937,0.04727841541171074,-0.035391323268413544,0.10034475475549698,0.03476861119270325,-0.028307689353823662,-0.05912308022379875,0.0008662746986374259,0.006069080904126167,0.02511332556605339,-0.048318762332201004,-0.03788795694708824,0.07946966588497162,0.06508049368858337,-0.09490317851305008,0.02294381707906723,0.009352114982903004,-0.03394029662013054,0.008545749820768833,-0.029592344537377357,-0.011175718158483505,0.10713071376085281,-0.007451173849403858,-0.010845503769814968,0.026829445734620094,0.018974389880895615,0.013203206472098827,-0.08112341910600662,0.06198503077030182,-0.05970170348882675,0.03402542322874069,0.06895425170660019,0.03782767057418823,-0.0336172915995121,-0.024522585794329643,-0.03345778211951256,-0.09459208697080612,-0.000979044009000063,-0.015070395544171333,0.035279881209135056,0.02104082703590393,0.029760662466287613,0.03156410530209541,0.009746460244059563,-0.002598999999463558,-0.1328836977481842,-0.08282142877578735,-0.0012137980666011572,-0.017266295850276947,-0.07018068432807922,-0.05443711206316948,0.0548667274415493,0.06566497683525085,0.04932102560997009,0.018423758447170258,0.03668157011270523,-0.016088178381323814,0.09366238117218018,0.0027826675213873386,0.021312005817890167,0.007746723480522633,0.02743975818157196,-0.023611705750226974,0.05405641347169876,0.04245321452617645,0.017180971801280975,-0.021903565153479576,0.006800481583923101,-0.033234164118766785,0.0018947500502690673,-0.03876747936010361,-0.05816531926393509,0.022125395014882088,-0.024202290922403336,0.048255693167448044,-0.044573746621608734,0.024083677679300308,0.01774563081562519,0.07951968163251877,-0.048951156437397,0.04203853756189346,0.03524802625179291,0.01805848255753517,-0.11894010752439499,3.344644729312209e-33,0.11293017864227295,0.005533069837838411,0.03754130378365517,0.05426138639450073,0.09855641424655914,-0.083051398396492,0.030567757785320282,-0.08357114344835281,-0.02021191641688347,0.08856707066297531,0.030058840289711952,0.024165665730834007,0.06668005883693695,-0.05497150123119354,-0.029788348823785782,-0.03467410430312157,-0.06696026027202606,-0.0742248147726059,-0.020533358678221703,0.023420987650752068,0.030867088586091995,0.034181226044893265,-0.007498300634324551,0.06110376864671707,-0.012712589465081692,-0.016892209649086,0.03207964822649956,0.07782242447137833,-0.005226356443017721,0.006640629377216101,0.019499272108078003,0.08927375823259354,-0.09639821946620941,0.044939544051885605,0.07860144972801208,-0.08080222457647324,-0.0075888317078351974,-0.050089024007320404,0.048789381980895996,-0.05429370701313019,-0.012871002778410912,-0.023508260026574135,-0.03690805286169052,0.012820199131965637,-0.06805286556482315,-0.028566807508468628,0.09740845859050751,-0.026953693479299545,0.03077029250562191,-0.11803843826055527,0.04509356990456581,-0.06726694852113724,0.03537434712052345,0.052486419677734375,-0.031338658183813095,-0.022455280646681786,0.12440712749958038,-0.0511510856449604,-0.0412125401198864,-0.0015752931358292699,-0.00806504301726818,0.02776169590651989,0.0024198044557124376,-0.02523593045771122,-0.0799221619963646,0.023783434182405472,-0.020071351900696754,0.022313879802823067,0.050122302025556564,-0.030605390667915344,0.018263736739754677,0.09696550667285919,0.08624177426099777,-0.051000915467739105,0.09719361364841461,0.04841617867350578,0.015363829210400581,-0.021822890266776085,-0.031582385301589966,0.06397607922554016,-0.023540616035461426,0.0005405715201050043,0.013975209556519985,0.011931524612009525,-0.09289152920246124,-0.04681338742375374,-0.04786078259348869,-0.11098169535398483,-0.06110121309757233,-0.07365213334560394,-0.057183731347322464,-0.0013389353407546878,0.11260385811328888,-0.08426769822835922,-0.0319552905857563,-5.499224855323688e-33,-0.003940137103199959,-0.022861480712890625,0.06967244297266006,-0.008288634940981865,0.04725157842040062,0.006905230227857828,0.017669830471277237,0.017772043123841286,0.01929568126797676,-0.05532403662800789,0.10527034103870392,-0.006311679258942604,0.06760527193546295,0.02475881204009056,0.06

{"title":"Data-driven diagnosis of lithium-ion battery degradation under realistic usage conditions","abstract":"Lithium-ion batteries have become increasingly prevalent in everyday life, from mobile devices to electric vehicles. In order to swiftly and robustly deploy lithium-ion batteries at large scale in a wide range of applications, an understanding of battery degradation as a function of operating conditions is critical. This dissertation focuses on building this understanding by generating extensive battery cycling datasets and applying a data-driven diagnosis methodology to diagnose the root causes of degradation. In Chapter 1, we introduce lithium-ion batteries and their importance to the global energy landscape. I explain the fundamental internal processes behind lithium ion battery operation and highlight the degradation mechanisms, degradation modes, and performance metrics that we use to describe battery aging.   In Chapter 2, we establish a data-driven degradation diagnosis framework that combines degradation inducing aging cycles with diagnostic cycles to probe fundamental degradation modes (lithium inventory, positive electrode capacity, negative electrode capacity, and resistance increase) and device performance metrics over the course of battery lifetime. We apply interpretable machine learning methods to deconvolute the effects of different input parameters on the target outputs (degradation modes and performance metrics). This framework is used to design battery cycling experiments and analyze battery cycling data.  In Chapter 3, we apply this framework first to an exploratory dataset to compare the relative importances of key operating conditions on degradation modes and performance metrics. The key results from this study are that charging conditions (charging current and cutoff voltage) have the highest impact on many degradation modes and performance metrics. However, discharging current is the most important factor for a few important degradation modes, and varies widely between devices of the same type depending on the user or application. These results provide the foundation and motivation for our main work: a study on degradation as a function of realistic usage conditions.   In Chapter 4, we generate a novel, extensive application-relevant dataset with diverse realistic discharge protocols. We then apply the data-driven degradation diagnosis framework to relate the effects of dynamic operating conditions to lithium-ion battery degradation modes and device performance. We first demonstrate that constant current discharging conditions are not representative of realistic use cases, and that diverse discharge profiles lead to differences in degradation. We find that higher rest states of charge predict higher resistance and shorter cycle life, and that larger values of the higher characteristic frequency predict larger resistances. Finally we reveal that under these realistic discharging conditions, cycling time appears to be more relevant than cycle number for analyzing degradation.   In Chapter 5, we summarize the conclusions from all chapters of this work, focusing particularly on the insights from Chapter \\ref{chap:realistic}. We also use this chapter to explore future studies that can build upon the results of this work. Proposed work includes both further battery cycling experiments and fundamental studies probing the relationships revealed by the data-driven degradation diagnostics framework.  Unrelated to data-driven degradation diagnostics, my first project was investigating the use of eutectic mixtures of quinones as a high energy density redox flow battery electrolyte. In Appendix C, I'll describe some of the work I did supporting this project that are not included in the publications of this study. In Appendix D, I detail the work I did on melting point prediction for small organic redox-active molecules, quinones and hydroquinones.  At the beginning of each chapter, I'll establish my specific contributions to the work being described. Additionally, given that data-driven approaches for understanding lithium-ion battery degradation have gained significant traction in recent years, I'll establish the scope of existing works (to the

{"title":"Resilient GPS positioning using deep neural networks and sensor fusion with factor graph optimization","abstract":"Autonomous vehicles (AVs), such as self driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles, will operate in dense urban areas and require decimeter-level positioning estimates, both of which are challenging for traditional GNSS-based positioning algorithms, such as weighted least squares. More recent algorithms, such as methods using factor graph optimization (FGO) or deep neural networks (DNNs), can potentially satisfy this accuracy requirement of AVs in deep urban areas by leveraging the computational resources and multiple sensors available on these platforms. However, these algorithms are susceptible to GNSS signal vulnerabilities, like GNSS spoofing and faults both in received measurements and satellite states, which must be mitigated to ensure the accuracy and availability of position estimates from these algorithms. This dissertation describes contributions to this end and discusses methods that mitigate GPS spoofing attacks and measurement faults. First, we describe a DNN for GNSS-based positioning that is robust to measurement faults, such as additive biases. In our architecture, we solve challenges that emerge when applying traditional DNNs to the task of GNSS-based positioning using specialized architectures and by estimating corrections to initial positions. We validate our architecture on simulated and real-world measurements, showing that it has better accuracy than equivalent model-based approaches in the local Down direction, and can have better accuracy in the North and East direction depending on the initialization error in our method. In simulation, we also show that our approach effectively mitigates additive biases in measurements. Second, we discuss our method that uses switchable constraints (SC) in an FGO-based GNSS positioning algorithm to mitigate GPS spoofing attacks. We use odometry sensors to improve positioning accuracy and obtain measurements independent of GPS to mitigate spoofing. We validate our proposed method in simulation, showing that it effectively mitigates spoofing attacks while maintaining accuracy similar to that of a naive FGO under nominal conditions. Our method also incorporates the upcoming Chimera signal enhancement for \"loop closure\" to improve accuracy in the nominal case. Third, we discuss our modular expectation-maximization (EM)-based architecture that jointly mitigates GPS spoofing and measurement faults. We formulate the positioning problem as a two stage process which is iteratively solved using EM. In the first stage, we estimate the likelihoods that GNSS measurements are authentic and fault-free. In the second stage, we obtain position estimates, incorporating the likelihoods of authenticity and fault-free measurements to provide resilience to both spoofing attacks and measurements faults, whichever might be present. We validate our architecture with realistic simulated measurements, showing that it effectively mitigates faults and spoofing while maintaining accuracy similar to naive algorithms in nominal operating conditions. Fourth, we discuss gnss_lib_py, an open-source, modular, and extendable Python library for processing GNSS measurements, file types and datasets. gnss_lib_py also provides baseline implementations of traditional state estimation algorithms and methods to simulate realistic GNSS measurements.

{"title":"Sensitivity analysis in structured optimization problems methods and applications to power systems models","abstract":"This work presents developments in differentiable optimization, with applications to the computation of marginal emissions in power system models. First, we discuss how recent results in differentiable optimization can be used readily to compute any emissions sensitivity metric (including marginal emissions) in optimization-based models. Second, we develop a general decentralized scheme for differentiation of graph-structured optimization problems. The methodology is efficient and can be made fully distributed, with convergence guarantees. Finally, we come full circle and illustrate the benefits of the decentralized framework in the computation of marginal emission factors. Using historical data, we demonstrate how the proposed approach allows for efficient computation of marginal emissions in large network models.","vector":[0.04962799325585365,0.014764394611120224,0.04908452928066254,0.026622405275702477,0.021275727078318596,-0.041430916637182236,-0.028000880032777786,0.0358312763273716,0.006829702295362949,0.05740077421069145,-0.03985404595732689,0.007524531334638596,0.09241243451833725,0.08082611858844757,-0.004966238979250193,0.0682532861828804,0.0492682047188282,0.032320644706487656,-0.05449667200446129,-0.053962044417858124,-0.01941572315990925,0.08654943108558655,-0.07156813889741898,-0.05625119060277939,0.0894160345196724,-0.09243188053369522,0.022902972996234894,0.0024293160531669855,0.03737018629908562,0.03548078611493111,0.01888106018304825,-0.03453918173909187,-0.06949644535779953,-0.006312336772680283,0.014348041266202927,0.0032395217567682266,0.006352333351969719,-0.024869758635759354,0.061966244131326675,0.08400314301252365,0.04095853865146637,0.007505339104682207,-0.008502381853759289,-0.02968149073421955,-0.04104894772171974,-0.015130355954170227,-0.0005246847285889089,0.03204932436347008,-0.007133289240300655,-0.05221617594361305,0.059055719524621964,-0.0484415739774704,-0.06916622072458267,-0.043524011969566345,0.10179109871387482,-0.1214909628033638,0.03417680040001869,-0.10005923360586166,0.03072466142475605,-0.02989206463098526,-0.0021317237988114357,-0.15539734065532684,-0.022658726200461388,-0.0027317965868860483,0.04351392015814781,0.033339500427246094,0.03660384938120842,0.021079344674944878,-0.023232806473970413,0.05282048508524895,-0.057914599776268005,-0.010918321087956429,-0.04494254291057587,-0.11941085755825043,0.014386354945600033,-0.0059346724301576614,0.08065202832221985,0.0455990731716156,-0.0017100464319810271,-0.11929401010274887,0.042837027460336685,0.11549867689609528,-0.013589923270046711,-0.02492719143629074,0.020589936524629593,-0.016696147620677948,-0.018673498183488846,-0.030379073694348335,0.09897800534963608,-0.024433815851807594,-0.012984986416995525,0.1224636510014534,0.006181192118674517,0.023461220785975456,-0.025288917124271393,-0.018839215859770775,0.07668618112802505,-0.02440328523516655,0.0028838717844337225,0.07984016835689545,-0.010388200171291828,0.020779820159077644,0.018429776653647423,-0.09361261129379272,-0.005920856259763241,-0.042839910835027695,0.003817869583144784,0.04302563518285751,-0.035172611474990845,-0.08587507903575897,0.0425916463136673,0.04111451283097267,-0.006093871314078569,-0.008128044195473194,-0.07547669857740402,-0.027694478631019592,0.0726974755525589,-0.05362735688686371,0.05980156734585762,-0.015502923168241978,-0.0466904416680336,-0.03763241320848465,0.04974167421460152,0.05088936537504196,0.021938256919384003,0.022037632763385773,-0.03374280035495758,-2.2321854824510493e-34,-0.03732464462518692,-0.0012363408459350467,0.008023395203053951,-0.06443529576063156,0.002565572736784816,0.027742791920900345,-0.03072969801723957,0.010219668038189411,-0.022212782874703407,0.03309813514351845,0.028387321159243584,0.030392393469810486,-0.049668990075588226,-0.01013248786330223,0.12543411552906036,-0.03571724146604538,0.008781767450273037,-0.0005264226929284632,0.07788485288619995,-0.02319670096039772,0.09906799346208572,-0.05609823763370514,-0.02684931270778179,0.08962170034646988,0.026057403534650803,-0.016488345339894295,0.0496208518743515,0.005385845433920622,0.034158844500780106,0.020315488800406456,-0.027202317491173744,0.07306426763534546,0.06268660724163055,0.08457357436418533,-0.007735059130936861,0.020406920462846756,0.012544449418783188,0.003162442008033395,-0.0032745220232754946,-0.007392254192382097,0.03406728059053421,0.014517074450850487,-0.010244982317090034,-0.09100690484046936,-0.11859073489904404,-0.02202625386416912,0.037886153906583786,-0.013757125474512577,0.028333207592368126,-0.07858816534280777,-0.09193713217973709,0.04823091998696327,-0.00011122777505079284,0.013154860585927963,0.022874297574162483,-0.019764650613069534,-0.01865767128765583,0.038002073764801025,0.0016515731113031507,0.01458978932350874,-0.07897575944662094,-0.017278848215937614,0.049342431128025055,-0.06529763340950012,0.02902975119650364,0.017292991280555725,-0.07301457226276398,-0.010308632627129555,0.05403652414679527,-0.0324794240295887,0.0013948972336947918,0.03753897175192833,0.004810233134776354,-0.0580691434442997,0.02238103188574314,-0.0948752835392952,-0.009896676987409592,0.07667697221040726,-0.07146639376878738,-0.017335766926407814,-0.0794481560587883,0.03895054757595062,-0.06169159337878227,-0.012455557473003864,0.021616868674755096,-0.1242336705327034,0.012720003724098206,0.085731141269207,-0.07940806448459625,-0.03308258205652237,-0.10200919210910797,0.02148214355111122,0.06980063021183014,0.035539764910936356,0.030474837869405746,-1.0732782293560778e-33,-0.06917748600244522,0.07409876585006714,0.06702014803886414,0.022893110290169716,0.04500988870859146,-0.07454323768615723,-0.06227356940507889,-0.06370412558317184,-0.033882059156894684,0.09703106433153152,-0.05699416622519493,-0.01926761120557785,-0.002532283077016473,-0.09525

{"title":"Ultrafast electro-thermal transport through nanoscale electronic materials and interfaces","abstract":"Although silicon-based nanofabrication technology has satisfied computational demands for decades, the aggressive scaling of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology to sub-5 nm geometries poses challenges that must be addressed at the materials level. One example is tuning electro-thermal transport in metal nanostructures to enhance the transfer of information and the dissipation of heat in integrated circuits. The manipulation of these pathways can be further optimized by integrating low-temperature passivation materials with varying thermal conductivities. Furthermore, the emergence of photonic interconnects presents an opportunity for the integration of electro-optic components that rely heavily on the movement, transfer, and recombination of charge carriers within photosensitive materials. All the above are governed by the fundamental limits of physical transfer mechanisms in semiconductors, bringing electron and phonon engineering --the control of heat and charge carriers in materials-- to the forefront of CMOS hardware design. This work explores the fundamental mechanisms and limits of electron-phonon transport in four individual material systems which can comprise different parts of a broader, electro-thermally optimized electronic system using primarily time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) and scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM) as probes.  First, we discuss the electro-thermal characterization of iridium (Ir) as an emerging metal for high aspect ratio nanostructures on account of its favorable resistivity scaling with thickness. The exceptionally defect-free metal films offer minimal confounding microstructural effects and allow the probing of thermal anisotropy and cross-plane quasi-ballistic thermal transport in epitaxial Ir(001) interposed between Al and MgO(001). Such effects reveal a transition between three dominant cross-plane thermal transport mechanisms which include electron dominant, phonon dominant, and electron-phonon energy conversion dominant regimes at different thicknesses. Finally, we develop a phenomenological model that correctly describes the dominant transport regimes, providing insight into the thickness-dependent interplay between carriers in metals as well as enabling quick evaluation and potential scalability to broader material systems.   Next, we describe defect-modulated thermal transport in sputtered aluminum nitride (AlN) thin films for enabling wide-bandgap (WBG), high-temperature, and high-power electronic devices deposited at back-end of the line (BEOL) compatible temperatures (&lt; 500 C). By controlling the sputtering gas composition during deposition using varied ratios of inert Ar with reactive N2, we demonstrate how the thermal transport can be engineered in AlN films ranging from 100 nm to 1.7 um in thickness deposited on both Si(111) and c-Al2O3. Thermal conductivity measurements are correlated with microstructural, electrical, and compositional analyses to investigate thermal scattering mechanisms that are elucidated via analytical models based on the Boltzmann Transport Equation taking into account atomic-scale Al defects that vary over an order of magnitude. A nearly 3X thermal conductivity contrast and record-high thermal conductivity values are reported, the insights for which can be optimized for application-specific strategic heat spreading or thermal confinement.   Finally, we shift our focus to present fundamental work on bulk indium arsenide (InAs) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) for low-bandgap electro-optical readout and sensing using the nascent technique known as SUEM. Using a novel implementation of SUEM, we resolve the transient electron densities and surface-sensitive potentials of both materials, exposing fundamental limitations on the carrier transport due to surface trap states, which is remarkable given the data were obtained by probing transient surface states at saturation, a condition not generally accessible with other techniques. Moreover, the resulting dynamics confirmed two fundamental time limits to carrier transport relevant for single-shot high-bandwidth and multi-pulse

{"title":"Computational applications towards 1D van der Waals and phase change materials","abstract":"This thesis focuses on the intersection of materials screening, machine learning, and ab-initio calculations, with regards to low dimensional materials - mainly 1D dimensional van der Waals wires and materials with 1D and 2D structures that are particularly suitable for phase change applications.  1D van der Waals materials are a less studied counterpart to their 2D dimensional cousins, but there exists a wide range of such 1D prototypes, including conducting wires that may be suitable as consideration for interconnect replacement candidates. We find exfoliation energies can be reasonable and of the same magnitude as their 2D layers, and evaluate their electronic property changes as we thin these wires to the 1D limit. Due to the fact there is a limited number of such materials, only a few hundred, we machine-learn to expand this composition space, training using the known compositions and using input features based on the elemental-makeup. We particularly target conductive and magnetic materials, as well as those containing transition metals and members of the chalcogen,  pnictogen, and halogen families, as those are often particularly suited for chemical vapour decomposition (CVD) and chemical vapour transport (CVT) synthesis mechanisms.  Previous work in the group has examined the phase changes in the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), and we extend this to a wider range of materials as well as changes where only the relative stacking between low-dimensional components differ. The multiple phases present can display unique dynamics, including switching mechanisms potentially relevant for phase change memory applications. We present a bottom-up screening across all crystalline material to evaluate their phase change potential. For the stacking changes, we study the 1T' and the $T_d$ transition present in select members of the transition metal dichalcogenide family. Past research has focused on the 1T, 1T' and the 2H phase transitions, where the individual 2D layers support differing structures. In contrast, the 1T' and the $T_d$ phases have the same individual layers, but a differing relative orientation that is present between the two. This type of sliding phase transition offers the potential to further reduce switching timescales. We present an analysis on the few-layer behavior of the transition metal dichalcogenide structures of 1T' and T$_d$ WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ with the observation that the energy differences are far more subtle.","vector":[-0.09706661850214005,0.01673274114727974,0.04736066237092018,0.053408119827508926,0.08276775479316711,-0.029909156262874603,0.026851339265704155,-0.0042222654446959496,-0.07090124487876892,0.04486651346087456,-0.07015284150838852,-0.06803259253501892,0.01460991334170103,-0.022209767252206802,0.027120694518089294,0.018194440752267838,0.003458697348833084,0.012161944061517715,-0.00554842222481966,0.09914902597665787,0.04134709760546684,-0.02911876142024994,0.08392757177352905,-0.05890553444623947,0.048023417592048645,0.05510590225458145,0.07058832794427872,-0.023888593539595604,0.02648989111185074,-0.07507982105016708,0.08072598278522491,0.011117647401988506,-0.1386009305715561,0.0720718577504158,-0.05175723508000374,0.007631667889654636,0.05087247118353844,0.02888789400458336,-0.012264575809240341,-0.015270480886101723,-0.01676531322300434,0.05440139397978783,-0.02088405191898346,-0.024516960605978966,0.0213183481246233,-0.046171028167009354,0.09671276807785034,-0.06612791121006012,-0.04446269944310188,-0.026912963017821312,0.11213403195142746,0.03615706041455269,-0.010368000715970993,0.06788598746061325,-0.0057457019574940205,0.020273994654417038,0.0029285424388945103,0.10238391160964966,0.004663039464503527,0.014019463211297989,0.016567261889576912,-0.06632360070943832,0.010272486135363579,-0.0743064433336258,0.014344480820000172,-0.014486146159470081,0.003784366650506854,-0.0021108349319547415,-0.017839236184954643,-0.057864926755428314,-0.09229661524295807,0.03492138534784317,-0.053966037929058075,0.034141477197408676,0.0817161276936531,0.10527199506759644,0.08005028963088989,0.04546298831701279,-0.010590717196464539,-0.04508185386657715,-0.05462420731782913,0.04506412148475647,0.029908934608101845,-0.04853633791208267,0.0453132688999176,0.07202649861574173,-0.0136125348508358,-0.0121657345443964,-0.03642921522259712,-0.07910563796758652,0.011505255475640297,0.06212906166911125,-0.0643727108836174,-0.05943330004811287,0.009230749681591988,0.033056460320949554,-0.0004829471290577203,-0.007760056294500828,0.09306471049785614,0.05906195566058159,0.04585270583629608,0.03623195365071297,-0.05038027837872505,-0.022575413808226585,-0.03511320799589157,-0.014297951944172382,0.07670393586158752,0.03437867760658264,-0.04602235183119774,-0.07690717279911041,0.0655391588807106,0.029834864661097527,0.0036156470887362957,-0.04716026037931442,0.026669565588235855,0.0060716671869158745,-0.02213011495769024,0.023506004363298416,0.07088515162467957,0.030207950621843338,-0.06607714295387268,0.073368601500988,0.0018021409632638097,0.07640509307384491,-0.04673608019948006,-0.0689590647816658,-0.07574360817670822,2.8768736501337727e-33,-0.011976945213973522,0.024751685559749603,-0.008115136064589024,0.05490926653146744,-0.024418188259005547,-0.06322324275970459,0.021858863532543182,-0.009980060160160065,0.013487281277775764,-0.01546854991465807,-0.03041439689695835,0.0167990829795599,0.0031893018167465925,0.03445650637149811,0.005317362491041422,0.023845724761486053,0.0636414885520935,-0.061005011200904846,0.06737542152404785,-0.03200012445449829,-0.03215133026242256,0.029230499640107155,0.06653835624456406,0.09517696499824524,-0.03759469464421272,-0.010612496174871922,0.02114785648882389,-0.019809486344456673,-0.010351918637752533,-0.021667052060365677,-0.0574556365609169,0.027619946748018265,-0.056229881942272186,0.030691392719745636,-0.03217634558677673,0.03460431843996048,-0.04008273780345917,0.04179280623793602,0.10041437298059464,-0.07463227957487106,-0.029735587537288666,0.002568158321082592,0.07968224585056305,0.06421900540590286,-0.09367616474628448,0.009455395862460136,0.08288868516683578,-0.005166004411876202,-0.017769481986761093,-0.06669692695140839,-0.05629989132285118,-0.0069187963381409645,-0.005835765972733498,-0.06621932983398438,0.013026543892920017,0.06232361122965813,0.09168287366628647,0.01737860217690468,0.08224251121282578,-0.016791056841611862,0.026775384321808815,0.04426413029432297,-0.04501973092556,0.053761232644319534,-0.10875546187162399,0.05703739821910858,-0.011793316341936588,0.03548301383852959,-0.007626254577189684,-0.09255622327327728,-0.025516314432024956,0.054372768849134445,0.12793222069740295,-0.0574931763112545,0.1322515308856964,0.0011996018001809716,0.0599563792347908,-0.11894223093986511,0.05932013690471649,-0.015132838860154152,-0.06912826746702194,0.05661740154027939,-0.03336826339364052,-0.09271521866321564,-0.08687818050384521,-0.11798171699047089,-0.007228500209748745,-0.060496021062135696,-0.039325665682554245,0.04290406405925751,-0.02998592145740986,-0.04546666517853737,0.07190711051225662,-0.03357326611876488,-0.03682999685406685,-4.478613640165745e-33,-0.02492896094918251,-0.0209337305277586,0.005562199279665947,-0.05319136008620262,-0.03374398872256279,0.011416568420827389,-0.006079476792365313,0.025142721831798553,0.03357473760843277,-0.02640386112034321,0.08773238956928253,0.009667636826634407,0.03139398619532585,-0.07774937152862549,-0.038887351751327

{"title":"Hardware and software tools to enable the study of sequence-function relationships","abstract":"Although humanity has become adept at sequencing nucleic acids and proteins, our ability to predict the consequences of mutations remains limited, as does our ability to design proteins from basic biophysical principles. Inexpensive whole genome sequencing enables us to rapidly identify mutations, but we are yet to realize the full promise of precision medicine: the capacity to predict the significance of novel mutations and, when necessary, respond with targeted treatment. Likewise, we struggle to improve upon natural protein catalysts, keeping designer enzymes, which would find applications from industrial chemistry to environmental remediation, out of reach. What we need are accurate, comprehensive models of how any given biological sequence interacts with itself and its environment to result in function (i.e. binding or catalysis). Since biological sequence space is untraversable in size and resistant to efforts to reduce its complexity, such a model will need to integrate over a far wider range of non-linear factors than any human mind can negotiate. Training these high-capacity computer models will require commensurately high-throughput generation of data that relate biological sequence to quantitative measurements of function.   Towards this greater endeavor, my dissertation work contributes a collection of software and hardware to enable high-throughput in vitro functional measurements of large nucleic acid and protein sequence libraries. To aid in the initial planning of massively parallel binding assays, I have developed notebook-based simulations in which integrated systems of ordinary differential equations are visualized to inform experimental duration and library membership. Next, to plan the preparation of large libraries themselves, I have developed opTile, a graph-based approach to determine optimal tilings of biological sequences, particularly for the purpose of high-throughput site-directed mutagenesis. Finally, high-throughput experiments require not just software but also hardware to manipulate physical samples and reagents. My work towards this end is represented in micrIO, an automated platform for microfluidic input-output which can serially introduce samples in our macro world onto microfluidic devices while collecting resulting effluents.","vector":[-0.03299232944846153,-0.08710723370313644,-0.06141597032546997,0.004206585697829723,0.016901744529604912,-0.05067259445786476,-0.07919789105653763,0.040931861847639084,0.003256619442254305,-0.050659723579883575,-0.07330506294965744,-0.06561055779457092,-0.05782197415828705,0.03759605810046196,-0.08748070150613785,0.055703092366456985,-0.035753827542066574,0.02903672866523266,0.0007450691773556173,-0.08946596086025238,-0.051125504076480865,0.05313523858785629,0.02166011370718479,0.0055059208534657955,-0.019216246902942657,-0.01625746674835682,0.06695133447647095,-0.03943617641925812,-0.0878916010260582,-0.08951054513454437,0.08151192218065262,-0.017533669248223305,0.009334289468824863,0.0013777976855635643,0.0133889215067029,0.05548759549856186,-0.040919627994298935,-0.1150166392326355,0.03325335308909416,-0.08939250558614731,0.05075014382600784,0.02530423179268837,-0.01967288926243782,0.03286397084593773,-0.0023336291778832674,-0.06726342439651489,0.03891946002840996,-0.04846004396677017,0.02242252789437771,0.051568832248449326,-0.07378116250038147,-0.030180417001247406,-0.04302791506052017,0.0010491396533325315,-0.002528431359678507,0.029253780841827393,0.07405097782611847,-0.12034249305725098,-0.01879764162003994,-0.038360726088285446,0.053924668580293655,-0.07401105016469955,-0.04336461424827576,-0.04063129425048828,-0.01985425129532814,0.011513611301779747,0.07474569976329803,-0.015056249685585499,0.015229769051074982,0.01134100928902626,-0.05212517827749252,0.04588504880666733,-0.017220858484506607,0.011734443716704845,0.030381441116333008,0.006531181279569864,-0.026767872273921967,0.037013620138168335,0.0646134540438652,-0.03851962462067604,0.005225333385169506,0.008388996124267578,0.019439829513430595,0.025698160752654076,0.05625084787607193,0.01698208972811699,0.040241703391075134,0.09411323815584183,0.09100822359323502,0.0376582071185112,-0.04561015963554382,0.01187053695321083,0.04718656465411186,-0.044357720762491226,-0.055475566536188126,0.08625443279743195,0.12377170473337173,-0.03751194477081299,0.013990831561386585,0.020575620234012604,-0.05334624648094177,0.10246147960424423,-0.005442847963422537,-0.05033493414521217,-0.029982447624206543,0.005339892581105232,-0.002523205243051052,0.07272376120090485,0.014143448323011398,0.00884720217436552,0.05774563550949097,0.008665250614285469,0.04187915846705437,0.08756431192159653,0.09118339419364929,0.005902160424739122,0.041164692491292953,-0.10180813819169998,0.0026096045039594173,0.07798797637224197,-0.0008137834374792874,-0.0004830481775570661,-0.03428620845079422,0.10441809147596359,0.005686966702342033,0.05889027938246727,-0.13811849057674408,9.331577415346264e-34,0.0035479438956826925,0.021779676899313927,0.06646937131881714,0.06348295509815216,0.005630165338516235,-0.06870526075363159,0.014822542667388916,0.008550135418772697,-0.07064634561538696,0.07962622493505478,-0.08977046608924866,-0.012262475676834583,-0.0027885932940989733,0.04921915754675865,0.038506414741277695,-0.029710406437516212,-0.002483304589986801,0.09201055020093918,-0.047789786010980606,-0.015533030964434147,-0.008712878450751305,-0.10463357716798782,-0.0516820028424263,-0.017968615517020226,0.02545909956097603,0.07978088408708572,-0.02916444092988968,0.027666417881846428,0.0209476500749588,-0.017323317006230354,-0.029627660289406776,0.02008754014968872,0.012148060835897923,0.04844037815928459,0.06580030173063278,-0.08116365224123001,-0.023390216752886772,-0.058472052216529846,0.023726878687739372,0.04350877180695534,-0.029142146930098534,0.05645719915628433,0.03177398443222046,-0.042019788175821304,-0.05535780265927315,-0.016206592321395874,0.02221694216132164,0.0812964215874672,-0.05369770526885986,-0.026016660034656525,0.034830089658498764,-0.025843454524874687,0.03598514199256897,-0.02836366929113865,-0.04862992465496063,-0.012176535092294216,-0.05177347734570503,-0.028469586744904518,0.06585182249546051,0.09239113330841064,-0.041025713086128235,-0.007619581650942564,-0.03117760829627514,0.07760927826166153,0.004251963924616575,-0.017063962295651436,-0.04020510986447334,0.04821375757455826,0.02408796362578869,0.1516692042350769,-0.0260297991335392,0.010674870572984219,0.07780835777521133,-0.061786383390426636,0.04953444376587868,0.0209729615598917,0.027286767959594727,-0.08569321781396866,-0.058006733655929565,0.09270742535591125,0.019847162067890167,0.08687208592891693,-0.04993579909205437,-0.009368151426315308,-0.030934065580368042,-0.10860595852136612,0.0053592766635119915,-0.05501952022314072,-0.0944988951086998,-0.039960578083992004,-0.04897740110754967,-0.024795768782496452,0.019777968525886536,-0.04778135195374489,-0.04283524304628372,-3.527342265368917e-33,0.045911647379398346,-0.07427210360765457,0.043851640075445175,-0.036518644541502,0.016809161752462387,-0.021550089120864868,-0.043267637491226196,-0.018319232389330864,0.010820536874234676,-0.05592077970504761,0.04664718359708786,-0.01942645199596882,0.06685370951890945,-0.010839248076081

{"title":"Data-driven methods for characterizing temporal variation in agricultural water use","abstract":"Satellite remote sensing provides a consistent way to monitor water use over large agricultural regions with field-scale resolution. Maximizing the value of this data, for both water managers and water users, requires methods for identifying temporal variation in irrigation practices and evapotranspiration (ET) more generally. Chapter 1 provides motivation and context for the problem of ET estimation for monitoring agricultural water use. Chapter 2 analyzes sources of ET estimation error introduced by meteorological and land surface data inputs, evaluated at three winegrape vineyards in California. Chapter 3 presents a method for identifying the point-in-time irrigation status of a field without labeled training data or ancillary weather or geophysical data inputs. Chapter 4 presents a method for characterizing stages of crop development using multivariate satellite inputs, applies it to the problem of crop planting date estimation, and also uses the method to illustrate structural properties of intra-annual environmental time series. Together these projects advance the theory and practice of quantifying agricultural water use with satellite remote sensing.","vector":[0.02845555730164051,-0.017844440415501595,0.03904334455728531,0.013101346790790558,0.1074165627360344,-0.03491432964801788,-0.014788394793868065,-0.06258619576692581,0.0437907837331295,0.03301779925823212,-0.027842331677675247,-0.05448180437088013,0.03943421319127083,0.020723819732666016,-0.04598855599761009,-0.03951713815331459,-0.1250809133052826,-0.038396626710891724,-0.01720741018652916,-0.12080115079879761,0.041558876633644104,0.04550175741314888,-0.1054682731628418,-0.09152844548225403,0.07282489538192749,0.020766882225871086,-0.0038185627199709415,0.02758927270770073,-0.07657147198915482,0.06215083599090576,-0.020468199625611305,0.1265811175107956,0.008296558633446693,0.0008412700844928622,-0.06741606444120407,0.025834867730736732,0.019395476207137108,-0.07511883229017258,-0.06399449706077576,0.06491012871265411,0.0011402397649362683,-0.06994432210922241,0.06615731120109558,0.02547098882496357,-0.0281703919172287,0.03561251610517502,-0.0005885119899176061,-0.016711756587028503,-0.02249576523900032,0.07122106850147247,0.05848390609025955,0.017824560403823853,0.02084510028362274,-0.02882419526576996,-0.017062142491340637,-0.07290323823690414,0.007552300579845905,-0.016140779480338097,0.013420424424111843,0.03892287239432335,0.012298117391765118,0.026187140494585037,-0.06684757024049759,0.004280589520931244,0.029896004125475883,0.020938752219080925,-0.04012362286448479,0.025941243395209312,-0.0019096701871603727,-0.07206545025110245,-0.04579758271574974,0.07905717939138412,-0.06625712662935257,-0.038872428238391876,-0.0674707368016243,-0.04925113916397095,-0.0001564026897540316,0.058041542768478394,0.06271207332611084,-0.09488967806100845,0.06068408489227295,0.053798750042915344,-0.058093536645174026,0.0062797293066978455,0.012687884271144867,0.03552922606468201,0.012782564386725426,0.09456291049718857,0.04220635071396828,-0.05855832248926163,-0.008196452632546425,-0.0472925566136837,-0.005847293883562088,0.04053299129009247,-0.04753391444683075,0.08491313457489014,-0.019651686772704124,-0.1232411190867424,0.007125708740204573,0.025315508246421814,-0.062235452234745026,-0.008854768238961697,-0.04232558235526085,0.027045506983995438,0.05848459154367447,-0.0684361681342125,-0.04611712694168091,0.006410255096852779,0.008497368544340134,-0.009909168817102909,-0.07657843828201294,0.011965190060436726,-0.0322585292160511,0.018435990437865257,0.004934333730489016,0.005052856169641018,-0.022280752658843994,0.036697693169116974,-0.01639999821782112,-0.029524004086852074,-0.02298363670706749,0.0025633869227021933,0.01304952148348093,0.04680335894227028,0.09325890243053436,0.035035986453294754,0.05676290765404701,3.1967903151818124e-33,0.025555897504091263,-0.03171990066766739,0.005309152416884899,-0.03359179571270943,-0.03977388143539429,-0.020237324759364128,-0.021163413301110268,-0.042432986199855804,0.06854688376188278,0.007660518866032362,0.03819901868700981,-0.035050295293331146,-0.02250112220644951,-0.015087584964931011,0.0888746902346611,0.06290916353464127,0.05090705677866936,0.05613446235656738,0.03121626377105713,0.056759148836135864,-0.01824011653661728,-0.11655843257904053,-0.029587287455797195,0.03148265555500984,0.04568073898553848,-0.04380548745393753,0.07062355428934097,0.07363368570804596,0.04040131717920303,-0.005260246340185404,0.1463240683078766,-0.04606498405337334,0.013171483762562275,0.008023926988244057,0.07276012003421783,-0.07048394531011581,0.0652088150382042,0.02934320643544197,0.07323271781206131,0.06254676729440689,0.02358096092939377,0.03523924574255943,0.09286443889141083,-0.03192019462585449,0.009373349137604237,-0.027178596705198288,0.0471140518784523,-0.047316357493400574,0.048827216029167175,0.01964735798537731,-0.031329575926065445,0.04691283404827118,0.09264931827783585,-0.08677107840776443,0.0179767869412899,0.050244662910699844,-0.015422879718244076,0.009844943881034851,-0.053303711116313934,-0.04902767390012741,-0.07709676027297974,-0.0580182820558548,-0.022844262421131134,-0.09216400235891342,0.008967900648713112,0.03699936345219612,0.05473688989877701,0.07247867435216904,0.03605583682656288,0.02492433786392212,-0.0284749586135149,-0.06383519619703293,-0.03539516031742096,0.02476106584072113,0.016660254448652267,-0.038822658360004425,0.07874635607004166,-0.006865736562758684,-0.01176695991307497,0.09704727679491043,-0.05077717453241348,0.005517664831131697,0.04088921844959259,-0.01864825189113617,-0.07241364568471909,-0.031907349824905396,-0.017084309831261635,0.0004910800489597023,0.0362187959253788,-0.048735611140728,-0.03454349935054779,0.07395647466182709,-0.09530194848775864,-0.053650230169296265,0.027549419552087784,-3.781202025372498e-33,-0.028804723173379898,0.08002163469791412,0.016595153138041496,0.046725817024707794,0.012594547122716904,-0.09217943251132965,-0.03209895268082619,0.040251899510622025,0.025690540671348572,-0.01240976806730032,-0.06563717126846313,0.0531037412583828,-0.06226103752851486,-0.0687716081738472,-0.0002763232914730906

{"title":"Quantum chemistry and quantum simulation at scale : leveraging modern computing paradigms and hardware","abstract":"Quantum chemistry has strong connections to important technologies and applications like quantum computing, machine learning, chemical or materials design, and drug discovery. At the heart of these connections is an increase in high-performance computing (HPC) power, largely driven by accelerators like GPUs. Improving how quantum chemistry methods are formulated and implemented to use current and emerging computing power is therefore crucial. In this work, I focus on two directions: scaling quantum chemistry methods to distributed, GPU-accelerated hardware to enable studying large chemical systems, and using tensor network methods to simulate and study quantum circuits for quantum computing. The fast evaluation of electronic structure is essential for studying the dynamics of molecular systems, for reaction discovery, or for generating high quality training data for machine learning models. I develop a multi-node, multi-GPU implementation of the electron-repulsion integrals—the computational bottleneck in many electronic structure methods—using the task-based parallel programming language Regent. This allows performing a calculation that treats the entire green fluorescent protein (GFP) molecule (3000+ atoms) quantum mechanically with high parallel efficiency. I go on to parallelize across molecular systems by implementing a distributed client-server ab initio exciton model, and present results using this model to study the excited state dynamics of the LH2 light-harvesting protein complex. Quantum computers are a promising emerging technology, but while real quantum devices remain error-prone and composed of small numbers of qubits, classical simulations of quantum circuits are important for studying the behavior of quantum algorithms. Here I present work using a classical simulator built on tree tensor network methods to study quantum circuits. I discuss the benefits and relevance of approximate methods like tensor networks which represent a quantum state in a compressed form, and discuss insights on Shor's algorithm for integer

{"title":"Realizing ultralow-leakage monolayer and highly P-type bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide transistors","abstract":"For decades, Moore's Law has driven great improvements in the density, performance, and price of silicon electronics. This pace, however, has slowed as silicon reaches atomic limits, e.g. mobility degradation as a result of surface roughness scattering. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, in particular atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), could overcome some of the limitations of silicon electronics. While n-type TMD transistors with relatively good on-state have been demonstrated, their off-state and p-type regimes have been broadly underexplored. In this work, I have investigated these regions of 2D TMD transistor behavior.  First, I provide an overview on the growth of monolayer TMDs by chemical vapor deposition and the methods with which we can non-destructively characterize them. This allows for the direct synthesis of large-area, 2D materials for electronic study. I highlight that this process can even deposit monolayers onto non-planar substrates, such as three dimensional sidewalls or deep trenches.  Next, I discuss our study of the extremely low currents achievable in the off-state of monolayer TMD transistors, enabled by their band gap which is approximately twice that of silicon. These were measured by fabricating ultrawide (~ 1 mm) devices, enabling the detection of currents as low as 10 aA/μm, four orders of magnitude lower than possible in silicon, at room temperature. We also use temperature-dependent measurements and modeling to explore the fundamental limits of leakage currents in these 2D semiconductors. Finally, I focus on recent work developing p-type TMD transistors, which are necessary to achieve 2D CMOS technology, by utilizing bilayer WSe2. These bilayer devices show significant increases in hole mobility and current drive compared to monolayers. I discuss the possible mechanisms for this improvement, such as change in band structure and material resilience to fabrication. This work suggests that monolayers may not always be the most optimal channel thickness for TMD transistors, particularly p-type. Taken together, our results reveal an interesting trade-off between high-performance and low-power devices with layer number in 2D electronics.","vector":[-0.01667616330087185,0.012534539215266705,0.09608768671751022,0.05488456413149834,0.010353333316743374,-0.06600859761238098,-0.012920364737510681,0.1001264899969101,-0.01940970867872238,0.0017481836257502437,-0.0228892769664526,-0.016820279881358147,-0.06663446873426437,0.009188972413539886,0.036360882222652435,0.03327137976884842,0.06888410449028015,-0.00027141039026901126,0.09607226401567459,0.02835143730044365,0.05271385610103607,-0.036686915904283524,0.05084924027323723,-0.04066327214241028,-0.03358222171664238,0.044016338884830475,0.08866390585899353,-0.005334256682544947,0.045249294489622116,0.013991539366543293,-0.02074708417057991,0.022440169006586075,-0.07077212631702423,0.0702427476644516,-0.041932813823223114,-0.039004791527986526,0.02019110694527626,0.06476912647485733,0.015396244823932648,-0.04847607761621475,-0.0130012147128582,0.016874127089977264,-0.01825934462249279,0.0404832661151886,0.018893372267484665,-0.10782924294471741,0.1441856026649475,-0.07095664739608765,-0.028723150491714478,-0.0691230371594429,0.07558756321668625,0.007472930941730738,0.06706021726131439,0.03542490676045418,-0.004715411923825741,0.03344840928912163,0.03328438848257065,0.0976245328783989,-0.04506060481071472,-0.004521690309047699,0.06422152370214462,-0.03812335431575775,0.023655608296394348,-0.05195419490337372,0.020588910207152367,0.03873319923877716,0.018046880140900612,0.04903385788202286,0.007038179785013199,0.05636083707213402,-0.07027756422758102,0.06722207367420197,0.034298356622457504,-0.07222894579172134,0.04520408809185028,-0.018969882279634476,0.004069845657795668,0.0381002202630043,0.051140062510967255,-0.0989934429526329,-0.02143755741417408,-0.06612364202737808,0.021851493045687675,-0.072372667491436,-0.08395714312791824,0.022442948073148727,-0.06773719191551208,0.022853689268231392,0.0030360661912709475,-0.035969167947769165,-0.03994876146316528,0.06004512682557106,-0.0838908925652504,0.00589754618704319,0.07102611660957336,-0.08078493177890778,-0.013264509849250317,-0.03596026822924614,0.04659218713641167,0.016688380390405655,0.05873288959264755,0.05889928713440895,-0.017117364332079887,0.02953963726758957,-0.01848028041422367,0.032815832644701004,0.0449831485748291,-0.01443012710660696,-0.04897002503275871,0.029508715495467186,0.07409030199050903,0.12094347178936005,0.010698992758989334,0.027755923569202423,-0.0248095840215683,-0.057604141533374786,-0.004668792709708214,0.05362807586789131,0.002437816234305501,0.01278954278677702,-0.0806446447968483,0.06203131377696991,-0.08273471891880035,-0.03654804080724716,-0.05642173811793327,-0.0409284271299839,-0.010929244570434093,-3.908929680329413e-35,0.05129798501729965,0.055226873606443405,-0.016653666272759438,0.0648583397269249,-0.014184808358550072,-0.06392451375722885,0.060917604714632034,-0.05604247376322746,-0.06047652289271355,0.0022811011876910925,0.017571646720170975,-0.06300736963748932,-0.01069796271622181,0.0658484622836113,0.10241838544607162,-0.07102341204881668,0.042822934687137604,-0.05244758725166321,0.0576590932905674,-0.03398508578538895,-0.028809238225221634,0.0068037197925150394,-0.028361260890960693,0.014567493461072445,0.012852804735302925,-0.034043945372104645,0.03143267333507538,-0.028441647067666054,0.004187410697340965,0.01951376348733902,-0.08256221562623978,-0.024322479963302612,0.016160747036337852,-0.05854646861553192,0.045689307153224945,0.07235906273126602,-0.08047579228878021,0.0257159024477005,0.07029253989458084,-0.10205427557229996,-0.06667683273553848,-0.016018208116292953,0.07536405324935913,0.002384341787546873,-0.07611896842718124,-0.050603482872247696,0.04050230234861374,-0.03762859106063843,-0.006613052915781736,-0.027708834037184715,-0.005529772490262985,-0.05662888288497925,-0.06384513527154922,-0.03649509698152542,0.0922430008649826,-0.044787775725126266,0.029567213729023933,-0.03373750299215317,0.0745428204536438,0.12042008340358734,0.03620895370841026,0.003801561426371336,-0.037847455590963364,0.047851018607616425,-0.09899185597896576,0.04363837465643883,-0.040419336408376694,0.031601399183273315,-0.05637256056070328,-0.005829995032399893,0.06448327749967575,0.05189071595668793,0.08657348901033401,-0.040548600256443024,0.0591839998960495,-0.022087248042225838,0.05601612851023674,-0.13491539657115936,0.06605825573205948,0.00047391251428052783,0.013913428410887718,-0.0012804464204236865,-0.06074567511677742,-0.11530663818120956,-0.08779093623161316,-0.03375629335641861,-0.09437324106693268,-0.06256642937660217,-0.04489310458302498,0.04111466556787491,-0.01659250631928444,-0.06640074402093887,0.008499972522258759,-0.02412625588476658,-0.033624809235334396,-2.7912234583130145e-33,-0.01804998330771923,-0.008042807690799236,-0.0004663588188122958,-0.06985796988010406,-0.08396217226982117,-0.00793920736759901,-0.003970516845583916,0.06161847338080406,-0.032106731086969376,-0.04263952374458313,-0.02406305819749832,0.06961924582719803,-0.018928954377770424,-0.08671320974826813,-0.007218779

{"title":"Boron nitride and graphene for thermal management : from fundamentals to devices","abstract":"Decades of advances in semiconductor technology have led to the scaling of silicon transistors towards nanometer scale dimensions, culminating in physical limitations to transistor size, and the concurrent issue of thermal degradation and excessive energy consumption. As the semiconductor industry moves towards continuously increasing computational density, for example from planar to 3-dimensional (3D) vertical stacking, the ability to effectively regulate temperature and manage heat has become a pressing bottleneck to the realization of these dense architectures. Thermal challenges in high-density memory and computation require new thermal and material considerations at the nanoscale. Accurate knowledge of temperature and heat transport within a complex system is the essential first step to successful thermal management. To this end, experimental validation of material thermal conductivity is fundamental both to understanding thermal transport and to implementing solid state thermal management approaches. The complexity of thermal transport within a dense system also necessitates novel thermal management tactics including active methods of routing heat, such as thermal switching.  This dissertation evaluates the intersection of nanoscale thermal transport and nanomaterials, assessing materials that show promise for low-temperature integration in semiconductor-based systems. The studies presented in this thesis range from fundamental thermal, electrical, and material characterization thin films to the design, demonstration, and characterization of an active thermal switch. We first present thermal characterization of nanoscale boron nitride thin films transferred and deposited at low temperature (&lt; 500 °C) for back-end of the line (BEOL) temperature compatible processes. We report the in-plane thermal conductivity measurement of large area hexagonal boron nitride thin films grown using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and transferred at room temperature to be 55-78 W/m/K from 300-400 K. We also evaluate the complementary thermal and electrical properties of low thermal conductivity boron nitride films deposited at room temperature using electron enhanced atomic layer deposition (EE-ALD). These electrically insulating films have very low cross-plane thermal conductivities (&lt; 0.6 W/m/K) with 10 nm thick films approaching the amorphous thermal limit of BN (~0.13 W/m/k).

{"title":"Silicon nanowires devices in energy and environmental applications","abstract":"This thesis focuses on the development of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) and their applications in the fields of thermoelectric (TE) devices, on-demand hydrogen (H2) generation, and wastewater treatment. SiNWs have been synthesized with different morphologies and compositions, leading to tunable electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and TE power factor.  In the first part of the thesis, SiNW-based TE devices were fabricated and characterized for their TE performance. The SiNWs were synthesized with a high aspect ratio and high porosity, leading to a high surface area-to-volume ratio and lower thermal conductivity. The TE devices based on SiNWs demonstrated high TE performance, with a high Seebeck coefficient and a low thermal conductivity. The enhancement in TE performance was achieved through the optimization of SiNW dimensions and porosity, as well as the doping of the SiNWs with impurities. The results of this study suggest that SiNWs can be promising candidates for high-performance TE devices.  In the second part of the thesis, the potential of SiNWs as a material for on-demand H2 generation was explored. The high surface area of the SiNWs makes them highly effective reactants for water and silicon reactions, which are crucial steps in H2 production. The unique porous structure of the SiNWs also allows for the efficient transport of reactants and products, further enhancing their H2 generation performance. The results of this study suggest that SiNWs can be a cost-effective and efficient way to produce H2, which has significant economic and environmental benefits.  In the final part of the thesis, SiNWs were used as a catalyst in the field of environmental engineering for the generation of hydroxyl radicals (*OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The combination of SiNWs with graphene oxide (GO) and Ni-doped FeOOH (Ni:FeOOH) was shown to enhance the generation of *OH from H2O2. The highly reactive *OH is well-known for its ability to efficiently and effectively degrade organic pollutants in wastewater. The unique porous structure of the SiNWs provides a large surface area for the interaction between the catalyst and H2O2, resulting in high reaction efficiency. The results of this study suggest that SiNWs can be used as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly material for wastewater treatment.  Overall, this thesis demonstrates the potential of SiNWs as versatile materials for various applications in the fields of energy and environmental engineering. SiNWs have shown great promise as high-performance TE materials due to their unique physical and chemical properties. In addition, SiNWs have been shown to be effective in on-demand H2 generation and wastewater treatment, making them a promising candidate for clean energy generation and environmental remediation. Further research can be conducted to optimize the TE performance of SiNWs, explore the potential of SiNWs as a material for other energy-related applications, and investigate the use of SiNWs in other

{"title":"Understanding the interactions of 2D materials and guest species for quantum and energy applications","abstract":"The deliberate introduction of guest species into a material to modify its physical properties has been a subject of extensive research for a long time, with a well-known example being doping in semiconductors. The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) materials with a layered structure opens new opportunities for guest species in two distinct interactions: gating and intercalation. These methods allow for reversible modulation of 2D materials without disrupting covalent bonds. This dissertation presents the development and application of guest-species modulation in 2D materials for potential quantum and energy applications. Three specific examples are discussed, including the creation of a 3D magnetic superlattice and 2D magnetic monolayer through interlayer engineering of magnetic van der Waals Fe3GeTe2; the observation of an intermediate state during lithium intercalation in twisted bilayer MoS2; and the development of a catalysis transistor to dynamically control the hydrogen evolution reaction.

{"title":"Morphology, stability, and kinetics at the lithium-electrolyte interface","abstract":"Batteries incorporating a lithium metal anode can reach much higher energy densities than today's dominant lithium-ion battery chemistry, enabling the electrification of high-value transport applications. However, safety and cycle life issues persist due to heterogeneous, high surface area lithium deposits which form at the lithium-electrolyte interface through a complex set of electrochemical, mechanical, and transport-based processes. This dissertation describes work using both theoretical and simulation-based approaches toward better understanding and control of the evolution of this critical interface. First, we developed a coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulation to model the evolution of lithium morphology during charging in the presence of a thin polymer coating. We created a three-dimensional simulation of lithium deposition incorporating a morphology-dependent electric potential field, a physical effect known to encourage heterogeneous, dendritic morphologies. In accord with experimental findings, we showed that a qualitatively viscoelastic polymer coating, which displays both mechanical strength and flowability, outperformed both purely liquid-like and maximally stiff, solid-like polymers. Next, we extended a field theoretical approach to calculate the free energy landscape for the lithium metal electrodeposition reaction at the electrode-electrolyte interface, accounting for the orientational and electronic polarization of a mixed-solvent electrolyte. Free energy curves for the initial and final states along a reaction coordinate allowed direct evaluation of the reorganization energy and activation free energy which govern the reaction kinetics. Finally, we developed the first linear stability analysis of lithium electrodeposition through a polymer electrolyte to include the coupled effects of ion transport, elastic mechanical response, and Marcus kinetics. This technique determines whether small-scale, randomized disturbances at the lithium-electrolyte interface will grow into largescale heterogeneous morphologies. Our model predicted a novel stability regime for polymer electrolytes with moderate shear modulus and high partial molar volume of lithium ions. This emphasized the underappreciated importance of ionic partial molar volume and can lead to the design of novel electrolyte materials for more stable lithium metal batteries. Control of the lithium-electrolyte interface is crucial for development of reliable, safe lithium metal batteries. In this dissertation, we present several studies which generate novel understanding of interfacial evolution and behavior during charging, which can serve as a guide for design of high-performance electrolytes and coatings for lithium metal

{"title":"Empowering machine learning systems for drug discovery with mechanistic biological knowledge","abstract":"Machine learning has the potential to solve critical tasks in drug discovery, from identifying new therapeutic uses for drugs to personalizing treatment plans for patients. However, datasets in drug discovery are often small due to the high time and labor cost of experiments, limiting the applicability of machine learning systems. Here, our key insight is to infuse machine learning systems with prior information about biology, so they can learn efficiently from small, labeled datasets. We find a way to structure diverse prior information, from molecular interactions between proteins to clinical annotations about diseases, into a heterogeneous knowledge graph. We then develop two machine learning systems that use the knowledge graph to mechanistically model biological phenomena and achieve strong performance. First, we develop the multiscale interactome, a machine learning system that uses a knowledge graph to model how drugs treat diseases across multiple scales of biology. The multiscale interactome predicts which drugs treat a disease up to 40% more effectively than the prior state-of-the-art, identifies proteins and biological functions relevant to treatment, and predicts genes that alter the treatment's efficacy and side effects. Second, we develop PLATO, a deep learning system that uses a knowledge graph to achieve strong performance on tabular datasets with orders of magnitude more features than samples (i.e. \"small\" labeled datasets). In PLATO, the knowledge graph is auxiliary to the tabular dataset and describes input features, like genes. PLATO uses the knowledge graph to infer the weights of a multilayer perceptron, thereby using prior information to learn efficiently from a small, labeled dataset. Across 6 datasets, PLATO outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by up to 10.19%. Ultimately, we provide a general framework to empower data-driven, machine learning systems with an extensive, mechanistic knowledge of biology.","vector":[-0.06401069462299347,-0.0071456157602369785,-0.0010793431429192424,0.007097568362951279,0.0068307784385979176,-0.047735460102558136,-0.00880389753729105,0.052880022674798965,0.009427848272025585,-0.02065872587263584,-0.06813666969537735,0.0021359710954129696,-0.02120393142104149,0.12940694391727448,-0.026343952864408493,0.05981915444135666,0.028980983421206474,0.06098873168230057,-0.08383646607398987,0.016271062195301056,-0.0011776448227465153,0.04515365883708,0.049189817160367966,0.038066208362579346,0.017100656405091286,0.021462079137563705,0.0023504996206611395,-0.03660200908780098,-0.020741242915391922,-0.02549763396382332,0.1048431545495987,0.02971752919256687,-0.024407384917140007,0.007576699834316969,-0.0835970863699913,0.035326097160577774,-0.004451107699424028,0.052014391869306564,-0.023904351517558098,-0.043182700872421265,0.04369600862264633,-0.002171505941078067,0.020998869091272354,0.11995989084243774,0.05303365737199783,0.005509195849299431,-0.04588314890861511,0.03712223097681999,0.12210007011890411,0.05082228407263756,-0.10683122277259827,-0.08211986720561981,-0.01646937057375908,0.03635917603969574,0.02570640668272972,-0.009788276627659798,-0.01930817775428295,-0.04989437758922577,-0.04294486343860626,-0.047324616461992264,0.06377994269132614,-0.08750247210264206,0.009497922845184803,0.00511297257617116,-0.04289408400654793,0.0025758412666618824,0.04400080814957619,0.06980251520872116,-0.05011538788676262,0.0045404634438455105,0.013075442053377628,0.0648297443985939,-0.07955152541399002,0.06072777509689331,0.04118497669696808,0.03145540505647659,-0.009565421380102634,0.022920971736311913,-0.007839984260499477,-0.07625583559274673,0.027576426044106483,-0.007447017822414637,0.038150910288095474,0.015379204414784908,0.1226857453584671,-0.036526232957839966,0.0042760311625897884,0.031601544469594955,-0.027519086375832558,-0.017793631181120872,-0.005227376241236925,-0.003642928320914507,-0.007248373236507177,-0.030396070331335068,-0.02042566053569317,0.0056490846909582615,0.006045541260391474,-0.12880370020866394,-0.019415223971009254,0.09056224673986435,-0.07103635370731354,0.049851540476083755,0.03235326707363129,-0.021720271557569504,0.001947254640981555,0.022461924701929092,-0.023969141766428947,0.04426633566617966,0.07011210918426514,-0.012948722578585148,0.045077428221702576,0.07604566961526871,0.044337641447782516,0.05536898225545883,0.053249817341566086,0.03591093048453331,0.03290066868066788,-0.014522421173751354,0.033356647938489914,0.07921671122312546,-0.0876200720667839,0.012973732315003872,-0.021975265815854073,0.02929692715406418,-0.08398345857858658,0.06415850669145584,-0.07733352482318878,1.783391095048271e-35,0.05885785073041916,-0.015047312714159489,0.10509904474020004,0.07239428907632828,0.018682286143302917,-0.036599867045879364,-0.04276536777615547,0.0007800947059877217,-0.06193957477807999,-0.015085805207490921,-0.10011928528547287,-0.010432716459035873,0.020420769229531288,0.07410690188407898,-0.010986223816871643,0.05505210533738136,-0.015220945701003075,0.004324160050600767,0.009539076127111912,-0.04248776286840439,-0.01801450550556183,-0.04968477785587311,-0.08899727463722229,-0.00027824542485177517,-0.024562712758779526,0.0766204223036766,-0.0033141521271318197,0.06882456690073013,0.03877321258187294,-0.04834728688001633,-0.09066003561019897,0.04294789582490921,0.06906704604625702,0.020921854302287102,0.026830609887838364,-0.03562702611088753,-0.0086736548691988,-0.05332512781023979,0.02652847208082676,-0.03796440735459328,-0.04767840355634689,-0.012867105193436146,-0.0068009644746780396,-0.051451604813337326,-0.024971824139356613,-0.010025684721767902,-0.013928105123341084,-0.03777661174535751,-0.07524462044239044,-0.11109784990549088,0.054685451090335846,-0.0012276394991204143,0.002176088746637106,0.0042718807235360146,-0.007239965721964836,0.0630074068903923,-0.03621536120772362,0.024745065718889236,0.040967945009469986,0.05393388494849205,0.017703188583254814,0.011628210544586182,-0.034073274582624435,0.06389118731021881,-0.025368457660079002,0.04409975931048393,-0.030104322358965874,0.0381375253200531,0.013809126801788807,0.04051634669303894,-0.05003046616911888,0.09004851430654526,0.008333374746143818,-0.0797954723238945,0.027990369126200676,0.016747133806347847,0.039622578769922256,-0.141582652926445,-0.052971549332141876,0.09428712725639343,-0.029976189136505127,-0.06422609090805054,-0.058573558926582336,0.01313720177859068,-0.039867572486400604,-0.050354987382888794,0.03155245631933212,-0.08193843066692352,-0.04718633368611336,-0.03912905976176262,-0.08986339718103409,-0.01335481833666563,-0.011427137069404125,0.03156427666544914,0.03207019343972206,-9.710630262448296e-34,0.016988160088658333,-0.0011170933721587062,0.07159741967916489,0.0003304312704131007,0.08523672074079514,-0.01166441198438406,-0.02689852938055992,-0.019527947530150414,0.014540423639118671,-0.006025291047990322,0.03331143036484718,-0.052330613136291504,0.0244395881891250

{"title":"Systematic characterization of gene regulatory interactions with high-throughput CRISPR screens","abstract":"Chapter 1: Hundreds of thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) have been identified across a myriad of cell types and conditions, but relatively few have been empirically characterized. Here, we present a scalable, phenotype-driven CRISPR screen to identify hundreds of essential regulatory elements in K562 cells by perturbing 7,500 DNase hypersensitive sites (DHS) around the top 400 essential genes in K562. In addition to distal enhancers, we identify promoter-overlapping enhancers that selectively regulate multiple genes. Using orthogonal CRISPR systems with narrow or broad perturbative windows, we demonstrate that fine-mapping screens can resolve and characterize core transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) within enhancers, highlighting the advantages of complementary CRISPR systems to investigate CREs. Lastly, we use our results to further interrogate how transcription factor binding sites hierarchically interact to drive enhancer function at the CBFA2T3 locus. This study demonstrates a scalable CRISPR screening framework for identifying and dissecting CREs that regulate selectable phenotypes. Chapter 2: The ENCODE consortium's encyclopaedia, containing millions of non-coding CREs has advanced our understanding of gene regulatory landscapes. Nonetheless, few CREs have been functionally characterized directly; determining the regulatory effects on gene expression is a critical next step, and pooled, non-coding CRISPR screens have emerged as a valuable tool to endogenously characterize the function of CREs. However, these screens' design, execution, and analysis have been highly heterogeneous. Here, we present the ENCODE CRISPR screen database: the largest, multi-center, standardized collection of non-coding screens to date. We evaluated the most common design and analysis platforms and observed that functional elements are enriched at DHS/H3K27ac sites, while the strongest sgRNAs target the DHS summit. Additionally, we discovered a subtle, previously undescribed target DNA strand-bias for CRISPRi in transcribed regions.

{"title":"Signals of an insidious pollutant : temporal, spatial, and biotic interplay of anthropogenic mercury in a terrestrial ecosystem","abstract":"Mercury (Hg) is a globally distributed trace metal element that is toxic in its various chemical forms. Hg concentrations have dramatically increased in the environment since the industrial revolution (circa ~1850) due to anthropogenic activities like mining and coal combustion. Climate change has exacerbated the pollutant problem by re-mobilizing Hg previously stored in glaciers, permafrost, soils, and forests. However, the fate and cycling of Hg in terrestrial ecosystems remains poorly studied. Understanding temporal deposition, spatial distribution, and biotic uptake of Hg all have important implications for environmental and human health. In this dissertation, I explore historic Hg deposition patterns in California using lake sediment cores collected at the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. I also assess how vegetation, soil, and geology type influence the spatial heterogeneity of Hg concentrations across sixteen terrestrial habitats commonly found in the Bay Area of California. Lastly, I incorporate DNA metabarcoding and stable isotope techniques to investigate the transfer of Hg through soil arthropod communities.  In chapter one, the sediment cores provided one of the first sub-annual records of sediment Hg encompassing over a century of trends. The combined record dates back at least 250 years, though likely up to ~1200 years. The record indicates an increase of 1.8-2.4x in Hg concentrations during this last century compared to the pre-industrial baseline. However, Hg deposition was also found to decrease near the surface of both records, which is consistent with declining consumption and production of Hg over the recent decades. There is also evidence suggesting that climatic conditions (e.g., drought, global cooling) affect the Hg deposition signals recorded in the sediment.  In chapter two, I found that vegetation type and cover have a strong influence on Hg concentrations in terrestrial systems. Closed-canopy forests harbored the highest soil Hg concentrations, while the exposed grasslands and scrubland retained the least amount of Hg in their soil. These findings suggest foliar uptake combined with litterfall and throughfall as the primary mechanisms for inputting Hg into soil. I also found that some soil types can dictate soil Hg concentrations regardless of above-ground vegetation as seen at the boundaries between shifting soil types. This would suggest that inherent properties of the soil are still important for the retention of Hg. Furthermore, there is some evidence that heavily disturbed systems (e.g., tree farm) may not recover their soil Hg storage capacity for extended periods of time.  In chapter three, I identified over 1,200 unique soil invertebrate taxa inhabiting the sixteen habitat types sampled. Stable isotope data suggested that relative trophic positioning of a composite community can provide similar insights from those obtained by assessing individual taxa alone. These findings indicate that higher trophic position is positively correlated with higher Hg concentrations. This implies that Hg biomagnification is indeed playing a role in the food web dynamics in several of these terrestrial communities. Our analyses corroborate the use of millipedes and collembolans as indicator species for understanding Hg dynamics in terrestrial food webs, but also supports the use of several coleopteran taxa as possible bioindicators. Some taxa were only found in low-Hg containing communities, indicating possible sensitivity. We recommend the continued refinement and use of these methods to expand their utility in assessing soil arthropod communities and their role in transferring pollutants through terrestrial food webs.  This dissertation provides new insights into the cycling of Hg in terrestrial ecosystems. By expanding temporal and spatial records, this work enhances our understanding of where Hg is stored and how that might look in a changing climate. This work also develops a new approach for assessing Hg transfer in highly complex and abundant soil fauna.

{"title":"Investigating drivers of small cell lung cancer progression and metastasis","abstract":"Most cancer patients die from the development of metastatic disease; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic progression remain poorly understood. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a particularly metastatic disease in which tumor heterogeneity has hindered identification of many tumor drivers. Heterogeneity in SCLC is in part moderated by the Notch signaling pathway, and we found that modulating expression of the atypical Notch ligand DLL3 changes the balance of neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cells within tumors. Furthermore, the transcription factor NFIB is a known driver of tumor growth and metastasis in SCLC, but the requirement for NFIB activity for tumor development has not been investigated in vivo. We developed conditional Nfib knockout mouse models of SCLC and found that NFIB contributes to tumor progression, but loss of NFIB does not prevent tumors from metastasizing using alternative mechanisms. We further identified the pioneer factor FOXA1 as a candidate NFIB-independent driver of SCLC. Our work shows the importance of identifying other drivers of SCLC progression and metastasis to fully understand the plasticity and heterogeneity of SCLC tumors.","vector":[-0.01690388284623623,-0.04360581934452057,-0.07465154677629471,-0.06799497455358505,0.0141693614423275,0.04289887472987175,0.002770292339846492,0.01837802305817604,0.023366976529359818,-0.01570274867117405,-0.06314574182033539,-0.007762233726680279,-0.04319719225168228,0.036291565746068954,0.014630014076828957,0.05974879488348961,-0.11571794748306274,0.011907056905329227,-0.07618006318807602,-0.07294600456953049,-0.049332261085510254,-0.0028874585404992104,0.03854408860206604,0.02147645130753517,0.03462998569011688,-0.06900741159915924,-0.010083881206810474,0.023031029850244522,-0.042450275272130966,-0.02588754892349243,0.06844327598810196,0.01850019209086895,-0.07925985008478165,-0.025532934814691544,0.040810029953718185,-0.034655045717954636,-0.0326283760368824,0.05578476935625076,-0.0844830796122551,-0.025096792727708817,0.050831884145736694,-0.012195329181849957,-0.03770114853978157,0.08836513012647629,-0.02502318099141121,-0.030692752450704575,-0.10812675952911377,-0.04254605993628502,0.030675552785396576,0.06444769352674484,-0.0265615526586771,-0.025403659790754318,-0.09267478436231613,0.12798281013965607,0.030462518334388733,0.07328516244888306,-0.08684060722589493,-0.009592668153345585,-0.009279814548790455,0.004789846017956734,-0.035642918199300766,-0.09566981345415115,0.005130063276737928,0.01187252439558506,0.08628932386636734,0.07965046167373657,-0.03279534727334976,-0.04370567202568054,-0.11862193048000336,-0.0018028314225375652,0.03399297967553139,-0.014050066471099854,-0.046142421662807465,0.06178450956940651,-0.03186570852994919,-0.040089547634124756,0.043321430683135986,0.08832217752933502,0.06399332731962204,0.038710590451955795,-0.028360774740576744,0.11242452263832092,-0.05411655455827713,0.03352241590619087,0.012769081629812717,0.01499364897608757,-0.050407759845256805,0.012444660067558289,-0.08258192986249924,0.1127760037779808,-0.00784990657120943,0.014839902520179749,0.033355675637722015,0.04958106204867363,0.03991660475730896,0.00947784073650837,0.02700394205749035,0.008807667531073093,0.007030656561255455,-0.006108545698225498,0.004002015572041273,0.010455982759594917,0.01748289167881012,-0.04045550897717476,0.03177713602781296,0.012304260395467281,0.015755638480186462,-0.010913711041212082,-0.08093693852424622,0.060272231698036194,0.004254302475601435,-0.02306031435728073,0.025749560445547104,0.006562384311109781,0.022006763145327568,0.0657554566860199,-0.01575823873281479,-0.027142630890011787,0.03639882057905197,-0.074703648686409,-0.05820617079734802,0.0113577451556921,-0.08784960210323334,0.05952487513422966,-0.0077201672829687595,0.09373565763235092,-0.0002768610429484397,5.5658309366351714e-33,0.08456233888864517,0.000210042271646671,-0.002667644526809454,0.13088035583496094,0.01930544711649418,-0.03116757422685623,0.01711893081665039,-0.005480452906340361,-0.09650129079818726,0.01844737119972706,-0.01177269034087658,-0.015890561044216156,-0.008230210281908512,-0.008958609774708748,0.010237038135528564,-0.06936758756637573,0.0017863253597170115,-0.053215138614177704,0.01585320197045803,-0.06260892748832703,-0.02340603992342949,0.0020824980456382036,0.00570724019780755,-0.05222544074058533,-0.07304073125123978,-0.022490283474326134,-0.0335918664932251,0.026887331157922745,0.017908530309796333,0.006337168160825968,-0.06520120054483414,0.052319012582302094,0.0409059002995491,0.011448577046394348,0.04155775532126427,-0.045313913375139236,0.0310173649340868,-0.041529495269060135,0.04274646192789078,0.11103465408086777,0.0325174555182457,0.02988390438258648,-0.05700809508562088,-0.0611649826169014,-0.05873873457312584,-0.13320598006248474,-0.020360656082630157,0.0017685388447716832,-0.04420989751815796,0.02561885677278042,0.034165773540735245,-0.009675037115812302,0.07660340517759323,0.051216065883636475,-0.036508169025182724,-0.017808860167860985,-0.07385385781526566,-0.0041710385121405125,-0.040452003479003906,-0.0029495235066860914,-0.0560334175825119,-0.04220044985413551,0.010912764817476273,0.11446098238229752,0.0751800686120987,0.04631118103861809,-0.04555412754416466,-0.02127794362604618,-0.002201662166044116,-0.008580935187637806,0.038838665932416916,-0.04663161560893059,0.03880726173520088,-0.04216291755437851,0.007487305905669928,0.020659275352954865,-0.02711506374180317,0.049774788320064545,-0.054919153451919556,0.11912018060684204,0.06762279570102692,0.08919462561607361,-0.09868073463439941,0.0845368355512619,-0.03016061522066593,-0.1721166968345642,0.007333740592002869,-0.028500819578766823,0.017000608146190643,-0.10228290408849716,0.0016390534583479166,-0.03481348231434822,0.04692983254790306,0.030124345794320107,0.02942500449717045,-7.309824844899842e-33,0.025620626285672188,-0.011146909557282925,0.11021293699741364,-0.05092194676399231,-0.020085370168089867,0.09022144973278046,0.06802506744861603,-0.0853392481803894,0.01297922432422638,0.001787126180715859,0.05562403053045273,0.07598726451396942,0.0077545009553432465,-0.06489439308643341,-7.25799

{"title":"Engineering biomimetic models of human brain development","abstract":"Human brain development is the product of spatiotemporally conserved signaling between cells and their microenvironment. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have the potential to recapitulate brain development in vitro as cells, either in two-dimensional monolayers or three-dimensional organoids, are differentiated from neuroepithelial stem cells to mature neural circuits. These hPSC-derived models are guided by our understanding of neurodevelopment yet remain limited by our inability to expose cells to the myriad cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic signaling cues present in the neurodevelopmental niche. In this thesis, I explore how biomaterials and biofabrication can be leveraged to engineer hPSC-derived models of human brain development which better incorporate biomimetic spatial and temporal signaling

{"title":"Computational and functional studies on the genomic basis of vertebrate traits","abstract":"One of the most profound discoveries of modern science thus far is that the breathtakingly beautiful diversity of form and function in life is encoded by the genome. Despite major advances in genome sequencing and functional testing, there is yet much to learn about how traits are specified by underlying DNA sequence. For vertebrate genomes, linking genotypic variation to phenotypic outcome is especially challenging given that their typical size spans hundreds of megabases to several gigabases in length. In my graduate work, I contributed to efforts addressing this challenge. Each study described in this thesis involved computational analysis of vertebrate genome sequence, either in the form of whole nuclear genome assemblies or of high-throughput short-read sequencing data, to identify candidate regions associated with and hypothesized to control traits of interest. For two of the studies, including my main thesis project described in chapter 6, I also performed functional testing to evaluate the extent to which candidate regions actually contribute to the associated phenotype. Together, the efforts described in this thesis represents genotype-phenotype mapping methods to identify the protein-coding and cis-regulatory sequence basis of disease-related and naturally evolved traits that arose over the last 10s to 10s of millions of years in humans, other placental mammals, and

{"title":"Probabilistic causal logics : axiomatization, expressivity, complexity","abstract":"This dissertation applies techniques and perspectives from logic to the study of probabilistic models of causality. It aims to shed light on recent questions and controversies by gaining a theoretical grasp on the potential and limitations of the latter. As a foundation, we first study logical languages capturing probabilities over a set of propositional atoms. We find that a division between those languages containing at most additive arithmetic and those containing any sort of multiplicative arithmetic robustly tracks a gap in computational complexity from NP-completeness to ETR-completeness respectively. We address expressivity and give several new axiomatization arguments. We next move to the analysis of causality, adopting the very popular structural framework. We axiomatize the logic of interventionist conditionals on deterministic structural models and show it to be NP-complete, and also obtain similar results for a few other related logics. The languages of the aforementioned sections express either probability or causality, but not both. The final part of the thesis combines the two notions. We define rich probabilistic logical languages delineating the three levels of the Causal Hierarchy: associational, interventional, and counterfactual. Inference then emerges as a special case of logical entailment. Interpreting our languages over probabilistic structural causal models, we give axiomatizations at each level and show that, in terms of expressivity, each level strictly exceeds those below it in almost-every causal model, thus revealing that additional model assumptions are necessary in a very strong sense to perform causal inference. However, in terms of computational complexity, the hierarchy 'collapses': we find that the satisfiability problem for all three languages is ETR-complete. Lastly, we turn to those additional assumptions that permit causal inference. Within the structural framework, these are frequently presented in the form of a mixed acyclic graph, on which methods like the do-calculus rely. We obtain a complete axiomatization of our counterfactual language over the model class of any graph that meets certain restrictions. Finally we formally define and axiomatize another popular causal framework, that of potential outcomes and Rubin causal models. Comparing the structural and potential outcomes approaches, we find that every Rubin model can be expressed as the abstraction of a structural model and that structural assumptions may appear implicitly in practice with potential outcomes, even though these two causal frameworks have sometimes been presented as though in

{"title":"Seismic signatures of volcanic eruptions","abstract":"Increases in seismic wave radiation coincident with explosive volcanic eruptions demonstrate that eruptive processes exert forces on the surrounding earth, exciting seismic waves. Studies of seismic radiation from volcanoes have been done to gain insight into internal dynamics that cannot be directly observed. However, traditional seismogram interpretation is nonunique and often ambiguously related to eruptive processes, which limits the amount of information we can learn from the seismic signal. In this dissertation, I develop a theoretical framework to rigorously connect internal fluid dynamics to associated seismic radiation in order to calculate synthetic seismograms from simulated eruptions. Based on this theoretical work, I present the procedure to translate wall shear traction and pressure changes into force and moment histories, which are then convolved with numerical Green's functions to calculate seismograms. This is referenced as the synthetic seismogram calculation workflow. This process allows for direct connection between an eruptive process and its seismic signature. This workflow is one of the first instances of using unsteady conduit flow models to quantitatively study seismicity. I then apply this workflow in the study of potential sources of commonly observed types of seismic signals at volcanic eruptions: very-long-period (VLP) waveforms and incoherent eruptive tremor. I demonstrate that rupture of a magmatic plug and fragmentation of high viscosity magma yield distinct signatures in the VLP frequency band with coincident modulations in mass eruption rate, providing observationally testable predictions. I explore an existing model for eruptive tremor based on particle impacts and turbulence in the upper conduit using steady-state conduit flow models and more rigorous treatment of wave propagation, finding extreme parameter values are required to match observed tremor amplitudes. I present a study of a potential alternative mechanism for eruption tremor due to fluctuating fragmentation, finding that stochastic fluctuations in fragmentation arising from advection of heterogeneous magma yield stochastic seismic signals.","vector":[-0.05896696448326111,-0.06278421729803085,0.11487333476543427,0.017254136502742767,0.05792458727955818,-0.10804323107004166,-0.11069431900978088,0.03948497772216797,0.06824619323015213,-0.08635185658931732,-0.029867688193917274,-0.09539221972227097,0.025300396606326103,-0.015325364656746387,0.001983105204999447,-0.0272735096514225,-0.04729211702942848,-0.007197658997029066,0.03594968095421791,0.010412151925265789,0.030449187383055687,0.031339894980192184,-0.1124885082244873,-0.01687070168554783,0.10298442095518112,0.005263042636215687,-0.047290656715631485,0.022172141820192337,-0.025957096368074417,-0.004254230298101902,0.045354779809713364,-0.042516130954027176,-0.01016286015510559,-0.01505305990576744,0.011632787063717842,0.0049957591108977795,0.008350417949259281,0.02232874184846878,-0.06755144894123077,0.12292194366455078,-0.009304139763116837,0.005220573395490646,-0.006529672536998987,0.013500665314495564,0.01535114273428917,0.000396237795939669,0.06440044194459915,-0.0987132117152214,-0.08374148607254028,0.08925926685333252,0.024850763380527496,-0.005580018274486065,-0.07312960922718048,0.03339033201336861,-0.037952568382024765,-0.07914301753044128,0.07168716937303543,-0.03905196115374565,0.07912323623895645,-0.04956912249326706,0.07916952669620514,0.0658072903752327,-0.01588691584765911,-0.008974798955023289,0.02514278143644333,-0.036767326295375824,0.02807837352156639,0.07734569907188416,0.018822502344846725,0.05814915895462036,-0.007549399510025978,0.11086051911115646,0.013493359088897705,-0.043128788471221924,-0.043177276849746704,0.04699704423546791,-0.005244738422334194,0.06453189253807068,-0.06822831183671951,-0.0909687727689743,0.05201363563537598,0.054345302283763885,-0.015386302955448627,-0.1473521888256073,0.021428929641842842,0.1059170812368393,-0.030454235151410103,0.06613953411579132,0.005726037081331015,0.014368529431521893,0.01889711245894432,0.010164055973291397,-0.021902523934841156,0.028727276250720024,0.17908529937267303,0.039777714759111404,-0.07040011137723923,-0.06078041344881058,0.05276152864098549,0.026878103613853455,-0.03300129249691963,0.0035202177241444588,-0.05636230856180191,0.053749579936265945,0.003626248799264431,-0.026375804096460342,-0.02898288331925869,0.09749918431043625,-0.006246787030249834,0.04219798371195793,0.045051995664834976,-0.03027288429439068,0.0013554053148254752,-0.061954252421855927,0.06788811832666397,-0.011070742271840572,-0.01723608747124672,0.0488472618162632,-0.05845050886273384,-0.039172280579805374,0.056517407298088074,-0.0794631689786911,-0.049994274973869324,0.022741954773664474,0.024260012432932854,-0.024908076971769333,-0.05167607218027115,5.1764157394886564e-33,0.07417957484722137,0.12330665439367294,-0.07339748740196228,0.05528833717107773,-0.00889967754483223,0.014886452816426754,-0.019901562482118607,0.04563099518418312,-0.018204407766461372,0.060731273144483566,-0.09194370359182358,0.11054272204637527,0.015163116157054901,-0.0012383817229419947,-0.05704326927661896,0.006393962539732456,0.007084696087986231,-0.011704294010996819,-0.07128456234931946,-0.019448015838861465,0.04756579175591469,-0.06670656055212021,-0.021525543183088303,-0.01640298217535019,-0.04438980668783188,0.02205020748078823,-0.023276541382074356,0.023287944495677948,-0.08375439792871475,-0.008939387276768684,-0.013648543506860733,-0.008122364990413189,-0.020614951848983765,0.030221255496144295,0.041863493621349335,-0.05678778886795044,0.04635957255959511,-0.018816931173205376,0.007281187456101179,0.0259720366448164,-0.014532339759171009,-0.006549951620399952,-0.042868465185165405,0.0446956641972065,0.03754938766360283,-0.022276336327195168,0.03231453895568848,0.06375391036272049,0.04188786447048187,-0.08860781788825989,-0.028403257951140404,0.02878161147236824,-0.009991751052439213,-0.017495090141892433,0.02109510824084282,0.030640318989753723,0.049398086965084076,-0.018959367647767067,0.007145857438445091,0.03875221312046051,0.009891745634377003,0.028562532737851143,0.03757840767502785,-0.03398510813713074,-0.05203930661082268,0.04482334479689598,-0.054268985986709595,0.039754729717969894,0.051723968237638474,-0.028763102367520332,-0.03324633091688156,0.08868877589702606,-0.0435543954372406,-0.04139239341020584,-0.018474293872714043,-0.0640648826956749,-0.02079329825937748,0.06505009531974792,-0.036550372838974,0.09779079258441925,-0.05414852499961853,-0.05574755370616913,0.03355573117733002,0.013374409638345242,0.018342837691307068,0.03332671523094177,0.09020349383354187,-0.020424984395503998,-0.09302505105733871,0.004130209796130657,-0.039685092866420746,-0.014063218608498573,0.07061723619699478,-0.05733543261885643,-0.012803826481103897,-5.526085635923947e-33,-0.02923715114593506,0.04390021041035652,-0.08306179195642471,0.037498895078897476,0.009574342519044876,0.01408593449741602,-0.006313979160040617,0.07608087360858917,-0.07495655119419098,-0.12785135209560394,-0.023915810510516167,0.03324146568775177,-0.024675045162439346,0.02764562144875

{"title":"Evolved and engineered molecular force sensors in the brain","abstract":"Mechanical force plays an integral role in biological processes ranging from tissue development to cancer metastasis, but the ways by which forces are transduced remain largely unknown. In particular, force has emerged as a potentially important driver of processes involved in the formation and function of the nervous system and brain. In the first portion of this work, I discuss two ways in which mechanical force can regulate important physiological processes in the brain at the molecular and cellular scales. First, I describe our efforts to characterize the mechanosensitivity of latrophilins, a class of adhesion G-protein coupled receptors (aGPCRs) that are implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases and control excitatory synapse formation. These molecules were hypothesized to function as mechanosensors at the synapse, but the physiological plausibility of such a hypothesis was unknown. Using magnetic tweezers, we demonstrate that forces of 1-10 pN, well within the physiological range of forces, are sufficient to accelerate the rate of a key conformational change in the latrophilin-3 receptor by 10000-fold compared to the rate in the absence of force. Thus, mechanical force may be a driver of latrophilin signaling during synapse formation, suggesting a physiological mechanism by which aGPCRs may mediate mechanically induced signal transduction. As a second example, I discuss our work exploring changes in the force generation capabilities of neural stem cells in the aging brain. ATAC-seq of activated neural stem cells (aNSCs) from mouse brains reveals that chromatin accessibility is enhanced at loci associated with cell-substrate adhesion in older brains compared to younger brains. We use FRET-based force sensors to measure forces associated with cell-ECM adhesion in aNSCs and demonstrate that these adhesive forces are heightened in aNSCs from older brains.   In the second portion of this work, I describe a new class of molecular tension sensors that we have engineered to increase the accessibility of force measurements in biological systems. These tension sensors are derived from the human muscle protein titin and can be used in fixed or live cells to provide either fluorescent or bioluminescent readout of the spatiotemporal dynamics of force transmission. We use magnetic tweezers to demonstrate that our sensor responds to forces > 2 pN and apply our sensor to living systems to visualize physiological, cell-generated adhesive forces. These results illustrate the utility of our tools for measuring molecular-scale forces in biological systems, which may facilitate a better understanding of mechanical forces in the brain and in biology more broadly. Taken together, these studies highlight several mechanisms that nature has evolved for force sensing in the brain and outline ways in which force sensors can be engineered to uncover new insights

{"title":"Greenhouse gas detection in the energy system : an integration of remote sensing and GIS database","abstract":"The oil and gas (O&G) system significantly contributes to global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The rapid development of remote sensing technologies enables direct measuring of point-source GHGs within the O&G system. These technologies, known as \"top-down\" methods, demonstrated their capabilities in measuring methane, carbon dioxide, and gas flaring by collecting radiance in the shortwave infrared using airborne or spaceborne remote sensors. This study aims to enhance our understanding of GHGs in the O&G system using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. We first estimated field-level gas flaring volumes using the satellite gas flaring data and a global O&G field GIS database. We then introduced an improved method for detecting and quantifying methane emissions based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Finally, we applied imaging spectroscopy methods to measure carbon dioxide emissions within the liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply chain, with a particular focus on LNG terminals.","vector":[0.04244595021009445,-0.09017007052898407,0.02556181326508522,0.03860709071159363,0.17317578196525574,-0.0930383950471878,-0.017704913392663002,-0.018593207001686096,0.07631739974021912,0.016634296625852585,-0.04594016820192337,-0.019746314734220505,-0.015256792306900024,-0.009371938183903694,0.04712627828121185,-0.007791575510054827,-0.006481444928795099,-0.028387172147631645,0.017132844775915146,-0.06505255401134491,0.02943851239979267,0.01906253769993782,-0.01934901252388954,-0.03614554554224014,0.029275285080075264,0.013955118134617805,-0.040784817188978195,-0.01041516475379467,-0.015879856422543526,0.019405469298362732,0.01141097117215395,0.023856278508901596,-0.02176378108561039,0.07638818025588989,-0.012100350111722946,-0.02816099487245083,0.12711048126220703,-9.822993160923943e-05,0.009376686997711658,0.04819295182824135,-0.020512575283646584,-0.11931890994310379,0.10400553792715073,-0.04217764735221863,-0.04404667764902115,0.04052243381738663,0.026055410504341125,-0.012932767160236835,-0.012272416613996029,-0.02766667678952217,0.006875529419630766,-0.014619243331253529,-0.05450188368558884,0.04763008654117584,-0.0205374788492918,-0.004700915887951851,0.01128020416945219,-0.07678672671318054,0.01651669852435589,0.027867527678608894,0.01432015374302864,0.03958611935377121,0.005629389081150293,0.011256552301347256,-0.010311114601790905,0.050956130027770996,0.033671390265226364,-0.021258428692817688,0.03570162132382393,-0.11046947538852692,-0.061290718615055084,0.06929318606853485,-0.04720709100365639,-0.01464755367487669,-0.07125888764858246,-0.0072526936419308186,0.02128463424742222,0.07286807149648666,0.0703098252415657,-0.07131925225257874,0.09744822233915329,0.053887054324150085,0.0010837934678420424,0.04782094433903694,0.006078747566789389,0.001890648389235139,-0.03746720775961876,0.07388841360807419,-0.029040804132819176,-0.05444994941353798,-0.04136324301362038,-0.08416443318128586,0.0030803189147263765,0.0957910567522049,-0.06305740028619766,-0.004726628307253122,0.09371761977672577,-0.08111254125833511,0.0035824489314109087,-0.050109367817640305,-0.041615407913923264,-0.011952011846005917,-0.054033033549785614,-0.010314385406672955,-0.010227621532976627,-0.005694167222827673,-0.008409714326262474,0.042419180274009705,0.10979080945253372,-0.022153610363602638,-0.025225380435585976,0.0545295886695385,-0.024888992309570312,-0.056286923587322235,-0.045062292367219925,0.011554080992937088,-0.05221550539135933,-0.029231902211904526,-0.05028194561600685,-0.031242184340953827,-0.005761011969298124,-0.0010968492133542895,-0.03437522426247597,0.058956872671842575,0.07947295904159546,-0.007297908887267113,-0.022952577099204063,2.6935066333100733e-33,-0.03685300052165985,0.06378582864999771,0.04740452393889427,-0.04766695201396942,-0.05136687681078911,0.020911768078804016,-0.09551344066858292,-0.07393684983253479,-0.025531476363539696,0.1344151347875595,0.04655321687459946,0.09085077047348022,-0.028547378256917,0.020799707621335983,0.04737505689263344,0.03510516881942749,0.02712555229663849,-0.0031913260463625193,-0.020808300003409386,-0.023495519533753395,-0.11094816774129868,-0.019417615607380867,0.07495778799057007,0.04216981306672096,0.05701997131109238,0.07996838539838791,0.044091012328863144,0.020668191835284233,-0.0029905785340815783,-0.005108668003231287,0.10469181835651398,-0.004060688428580761,-0.03926071524620056,-0.004602538421750069,-0.012572471052408218,-0.14571815729141235,-0.05531667172908783,0.027712205424904823,-0.05975152552127838,0.011478877626359463,0.0155022032558918,0.08298448473215103,-0.03070458211004734,-0.07051895558834076,-0.03248540312051773,0.016941115260124207,-0.0067848386242985725,-0.06288798153400421,0.09129685163497925,0.02352890931069851,-0.026722852140665054,0.031598180532455444,-0.04828726872801781,0.028176629915833473,0.06323926150798798,0.01341419480741024,0.07515110820531845,-0.08001158386468887,-0.021921569481492043,-0.05186993256211281,-0.06656919419765472,-0.03569392114877701,0.034643787890672684,-0.011055553331971169,-0.023849347606301308,-0.013186979107558727,-0.010401255451142788,0.06700737774372101,0.0022337017580866814,0.07421243190765381,0.022447938099503517,0.0033338014036417007,0.09738177806138992,0.019310766831040382,0.01000895444303751,-0.039402298629283905,0.04894609376788139,0.020559320226311684,0.03586014732718468,0.10107678920030594,-0.06577254831790924,-0.0286980289965868,0.10266649723052979,-0.04558048024773598,-0.10947953164577484,-0.011811604723334312,-0.044205546379089355,-0.02149723283946514,-0.00939718447625637,-0.00863432977348566,-0.13592833280563354,-0.020286334678530693,-0.06343378871679306,-0.0340389683842659,-0.07996770739555359,-3.3837824463808524e-33,0.003319439245387912,0.047964151948690414,-0.0036768412683159113,-0.04053555056452751,-0.02626221813261509,-0.04291272163391113,0.009486381895840168,0.01851130649447441,-0.020913969725370407,0.03247625753283501,0.011808128096163273,0.06884022802114487,-0.04450517147

{"title":"Neural computation through the lense of recurrent dynamics","abstract":"Recurrent connections, consisting of not only feedforward but also feedback connections between neurons, shape dynamics of population neural activity, which is thought to underlie our mental processes. Despite their ubiquity in the brain, their computational roles are less understood compared to their feedforward counterpart. In this dissertation, we present three studies that make progress toward improving our understanding of the recurrent neural dynamics. In the first part of the dissertation, we address the question \"how does the brain perform computations while being robust to perturbations?\" in the context of a short-term memory task, which relies on recurrent neural dynamics. We found that a frontal cortical region called anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) that maintains short-term memory in this task achieves robustness through a modular organization which prevents spreading of a perturbation on one hemisphere to the other hemisphere. In addition, this region exhibited an error-correction property whereby the short-term memory of a perturbed hemisphere is rapidly recovered by input from the other intact hemisphere. We present evidence that a state-dependent gating of interhemispheric interactions underlies both the modularity and error correction property of ALM, through dynamic modeling of single-trial neural data and optogenetic perturbation experiments. Furthermore, we studied how such robust dynamics could arise in a highly connected network of neurons through recurrent neural network (RNN) modeling, and identified three necessary and sufficient conditions that made RNNs robust. This provides insight into how ALM can develop robust dynamics without experiencing perturbations during learning. In the second part of the dissertation, we tackle the problem of identifying the most \"useful\" perturbations to dissect a given neural circuit. We propose that if a perturbation is to be useful, it should be able to maximally discriminate distinct hypotheses about a neural circuit, and provide a mathematical framework to derive \"optimal\" perturbations according to this criterion. Specifically, we formulate distinct hypotheses as distinct priors on the weights of RNNs fit to neural data, and optimize the initial state to maximize the trajectory separation between the different RNNs. This initial state is our proposed optimal perturbation. We demonstrate the practicality of our framework by applying it to distinguish different proposed models of recurrent dynamics underlying short-term memory. The last part of dissertation is concerned with whether and how recurrent computation can facilitate recognition of objects under occlusion, which has been considered a challenging computational task. An intuitive suggestion for solving this task has been the explain-away computation, whereby the altered appearance of the occluded object is explained away as due to the occluder. We show that this explain-away computation arises naturally in recurrent, but not feedforward, models of the visual pathway, without any constraints placed on them. This suggests that the explain-away computation may be a type of neural computation that recurrent connections can uniquely perform. In summary, these three studies shed light on what kind of computations recurrent connections can perform, how they perform these computations, and how we can distinguish distinct recurrent models of

{"title":"Algorithms and numerical analysis in quantum computing","abstract":"This dissertation delves into multiple facets of quantum computing and quantum algorithms from the perspective of an applied mathematician or numerical analyst and is segmented into four parts: 1. Efficient and Robust Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) Algorithms: The first part presents a suite of efficient and robust QPE algorithms, tailored for early fault-tolerant quantum devices in the sense that they (1) use a minimal number of ancilla qubits, (2) allow for inexact initial states with a significant residual, (3) achieve the Heisenberg limit for the total resource used, and (4) have a diminishing prefactor for the maximum circuit length when the residual approaches zero. 2. Advanced Hamiltonian Learning Techniques: The second part discusses two efficient algorithms that deal with the Hamiltonian learning problem for many-body Fermionic and Bosonic systems. 3. Block-encoding of Pseudo-Differential Operators: In the third chapter, the focus shifts to the development of novel algorithms for the encoding of pseudo-differential operators, enhancing the quantum computing toolkit with more explicit and effective block-encoding strategies. 4.

{"title":"Deliberation and communication under Chinese authoritarian influence : the cases of Macau and Hong Kong","abstract":"This dissertation examines public discourse in two semi-authoritarian contexts, the Chinese territories of Macau and Hong Kong, through two empirical studies.  It concludes that while it is possible to satisfy the high standards of a successful deliberative mini-public in these environments, under current political conditions, significant barriers remain to the development of deliberative authoritarianism.","vector":[0.16870391368865967,0.03260018303990364,0.011164465919137001,-0.013177189975976944,0.00427264254540205,0.013985257595777512,-0.00397935975342989,-0.11420636624097824,-0.0131429024040699,-0.014401420019567013,0.06353957206010818,-0.029234007000923157,-0.028135955333709717,-0.1370527595281601,0.10276404023170471,0.03572101891040802,0.018604112789034843,0.0015535310376435518,0.011914676055312157,0.04791214317083359,0.0042235879227519035,-0.012000762857496738,-0.024858923628926277,0.11300764232873917,-0.030473316088318825,-0.03750329464673996,0.08793706446886063,0.031486038118600845,-0.019159633666276932,0.00542250694707036,-0.006995039060711861,0.004330277442932129,0.044678375124931335,0.03553786873817444,0.08508820086717606,0.08961523324251175,0.06984271854162216,-0.02338826283812523,0.03436288237571716,-0.03255655989050865,0.0694592148065567,0.015557631850242615,0.10321316123008728,-0.074639230966568,0.01295507699251175,-0.020520439371466637,0.03131243586540222,0.00037791699287481606,-0.09682295471429825,-0.09236013889312744,0.040136225521564484,0.027912311255931854,0.05211888253688812,0.012520276941359043,0.05995996296405792,-0.0014770150883123279,0.0010757822310552,0.054623741656541824,0.05401477590203285,-0.05378008633852005,-0.04187280684709549,0.021011948585510254,-0.07540300488471985,0.008351276628673077,0.11093471944332123,-0.025565342977643013,0.010668210685253143,-0.00989600457251072,0.01859414577484131,-8.957263344200328e-05,-0.015014386735856533,0.016224510967731476,0.08544708788394928,0.026473775506019592,-0.10829182714223862,-0.10326560586690903,0.016187140718102455,-0.02304735593497753,0.05876510217785835,-0.05760546773672104,0.057809993624687195,0.09602583199739456,0.051170166581869125,0.00405696127563715,-0.02548869512975216,-0.11260275542736053,-0.07542884349822998,0.002643855754286051,0.032924383878707886,0.0010121917584910989,0.0006082848994992673,0.07842697948217392,0.015498977154493332,0.04687163233757019,-0.001025418983772397,-0.06066365912556648,-0.005765742622315884,0.025526462122797966,0.023557694628834724,0.06158087030053139,0.029755931347608566,0.11933175474405289,-0.006161234807223082,-0.010484498925507069,0.011186700314283371,-0.04827065020799637,0.009694100357592106,-0.017490459606051445,-0.07034044712781906,0.0970473363995552,-0.07409440726041794,-0.06627819687128067,-0.013757023960351944,-0.034106481820344925,0.09896053373813629,-0.025604700669646263,0.0047339159063994884,0.019429299980401993,-0.10456090420484543,-0.021089574322104454,-0.043103866279125214,-0.07137904316186905,0.0020321414340287447,-0.009449047967791557,0.047246962785720825,-0.0319092757999897,0.0022005336359143257,-2.1616571530164063e-33,-0.047869496047496796,-0.041731275618076324,-0.07077808678150177,0.11546341329813004,-0.038050562143325806,-0.03936954587697983,-0.0144887026399374,-0.02680031768977642,-0.0419573150575161,0.045194584876298904,0.08305086195468903,0.0016142948297783732,0.022752795368433,-0.020850447937846184,0.10951653867959976,-0.04645161330699921,-0.04210560396313667,0.019926654174923897,0.002176548121497035,-0.052834004163742065,-0.0439101867377758,0.07970181852579117,-0.026683108881115913,-0.05580981820821762,0.024106871336698532,-0.0300880279392004,0.06217867508530617,-0.08822247385978699,0.00587233854457736,0.027380798012018204,0.03492235392332077,0.0265039075165987,-0.0027935761027038097,0.009232313372194767,0.08162081241607666,-0.08569923788309097,0.007409186568111181,0.018264135345816612,0.025271663442254066,0.009941442869603634,-0.011265070177614689,-0.044667456299066544,-0.013610814698040485,-0.014685831032693386,0.029667625203728676,0.002653823932632804,-0.04792717844247818,-0.05914759635925293,0.016885260120034218,-0.029406622052192688,0.08436069637537003,-0.022454870864748955,-0.05280069261789322,0.020281609147787094,0.060958586633205414,-0.09772215783596039,-0.07823623716831207,-0.018340013921260834,0.032477542757987976,-0.08553581684827805,0.009124211966991425,0.0412864163517952,-0.054809823632240295,0.029495976865291595,0.039538148790597916,-0.01992301642894745,-0.08217078447341919,-0.019579166546463966,0.08023717254400253,-0.020107479766011238,0.05343890190124512,-0.018304254859685898,-0.015267708338797092,-0.008532993495464325,-0.03514530137181282,0.010125987231731415,-0.11856963485479355,-0.056695930659770966,0.0010222098790109158,0.08156415820121765,-0.04284735023975372,0.01024691853672266,0.033564068377017975,0.06246877461671829,0.040711503475904465,-0.0025760780554264784,-0.008197532966732979,0.04714510962367058,0.12823812663555145,0.02688547410070896,-0.09553652256727219,-0.03228846564888954,-0.012204627506434917,-0.05244394391775131,-0.054970093071460724,-4.334131241783278e-34,-0.021269237622618675,-0.00034812555531971157,-0.038950078189373016,0.03549379110336304,-0.011621871963143349,0.05782804265618324,-0.041717905551195145,-0.01649351604282856,-0.03759763762354851,-0.03566249832510948,-0.08505615592002869,-0.04992028325796127,0.080608054

{"title":"Better prediction through design : new tools for learning health systems","abstract":"The act of prediction is ubiquitous in health care--be it via clinician gestalt, or through algorithms. Increasingly, predictive algorithms are beginning to displace clinician decision-making and to drive interventions of all types. Underscoring their importance, just one category of clinical predictive algorithms alone--those used for case management--is used to drive care for over 200 million individuals in the U.S. each year. However, evidence remains scant that algorithm deployments for this and other use cases actually improve clinical outcomes. This evidence gap is further compounded by the particular impracticality of conducting randomized controlled trials to study these algorithms' impacts, and by the lack of alternative design approaches. Moreover, there also exists a currently-unmet need for approaches to iteration on preexisting algorithmic deployments, so that an intervention can be re-prioritized to the patients most likely to benefit. This thesis attempts to fill this methodological vacuum using established tools from causal inference, with the problem of hospital readmission prediction and prevention as a test case.","vector":[-0.05309605970978737,0.017677798867225647,0.012133373878896236,0.013064730912446976,0.026681993156671524,0.006991125643253326,-0.03497188910841942,0.03322349861264229,-0.030630232766270638,0.036709073930978775,-0.07224658131599426,0.05150006711483002,0.02277795970439911,0.06283074617385864,-0.03274475783109665,-0.04919488728046417,0.09854228794574738,-0.0010819106828421354,0.026585577055811882,-0.041042957454919815,-0.012792875990271568,0.04185902327299118,-0.029700303450226784,0.07340972870588303,-0.029625965282320976,-0.05012758821249008,-0.044013213366270065,-0.05281493067741394,0.002400151453912258,0.04473038762807846,0.08576197922229767,-0.01831262744963169,-0.026779761537909508,-0.07560735940933228,-0.1103530153632164,0.0029623243026435375,-0.056804198771715164,0.016950061544775963,-0.003972188103944063,0.053949933499097824,-0.021464213728904724,-0.015877235680818558,-0.005774316377937794,0.06940185278654099,0.07141455262899399,0.015522656962275505,-0.06149965152144432,0.01750706508755684,-0.08359722048044205,0.03324441611766815,-0.1478050798177719,-0.03385114297270775,-0.01600879617035389,0.01355902012437582,-0.0043755220249295235,-0.048793502151966095,0.11832662671804428,-0.07221626490354538,-0.0853220596909523,-0.04475755617022514,-0.049172669649124146,-0.11738821864128113,-0.06375405937433243,-0.0030467738397419453,-0.034747153520584106,0.09111709892749786,0.038268208503723145,-0.03410840407013893,-0.00150187942199409,0.015003561042249203,0.02146737463772297,0.05428015813231468,-0.027764327824115753,0.08608601987361908,0.052062954753637314,0.06564351916313171,0.07436034828424454,0.086496502161026,0.03378515690565109,-0.05389241501688957,0.025325005874037743,0.0730324387550354,-0.02101580798625946,0.04123396798968315,0.03735630586743355,0.011766882613301277,0.01711382530629635,0.009362928569316864,0.020546572282910347,-0.014192276634275913,0.059097323566675186,-0.0029354942962527275,-0.0135682113468647,-0.015165328979492188,-0.0184901412576437,0.021239638328552246,-0.005176786333322525,-0.053609464317560196,0.01482346374541521,0.052226144820451736,0.025716518983244896,-0.03476553037762642,0.05211537331342697,-0.04010804742574692,-0.02079169452190399,-0.11249539256095886,0.03059055283665657,-0.011106502264738083,0.025111636146903038,-0.014946612529456615,0.04496902972459793,-0.004363554529845715,0.07272686064243317,-0.042953647673130035,-0.05429680645465851,-0.03810165077447891,-0.017093228176236153,0.02119731530547142,0.021205609664320946,0.08046393096446991,0.06754114478826523,-0.008996685035526752,0.043742720037698746,-0.03312855213880539,0.029758436605334282,0.016503816470503807,-0.10039118677377701,5.827064168625278e-34,0.017020078375935555,-0.10720802843570709,0.12385144829750061,0.016369258984923363,-0.009602890349924564,-0.08530605584383011,-0.050853125751018524,-0.032404668629169464,0.03445002809166908,-0.0798007994890213,0.01477830670773983,0.013606344349682331,-0.04878293350338936,0.05476535111665726,0.036338359117507935,0.06030145287513733,0.0022376824636012316,0.036032289266586304,-0.10427562147378922,-0.019241636618971825,0.02744482085108757,-0.07036365568637848,-0.026306064799427986,-0.022326426580548286,-0.05130443349480629,0.007722068578004837,-0.020076168701052666,-0.026416078209877014,0.0030458734836429358,0.04174051061272621,-0.040647149085998535,0.024619175121188164,0.03921407461166382,0.06781849265098572,-0.04602954536676407,-0.009592014364898205,-0.05679507181048393,-0.04447249323129654,0.014311299659311771,0.020968647673726082,-0.0776510164141655,-0.02224517986178398,0.10548745840787888,0.011544429697096348,0.008923775516450405,-0.09042848646640778,-0.08306054025888443,-0.01943528652191162,-0.03472291678190231,-0.007330264896154404,0.05403393879532814,-0.062395256012678146,-0.037040937691926956,-0.0326402448117733,-0.0628003478050232,0.05196380242705345,-0.012997082434594631,-0.008541573770344257,0.0007235415396280587,0.03657856583595276,0.052653927356004715,0.0008738648029975593,0.01443980261683464,0.02369503490626812,-0.053084034472703934,0.010748549364507198,0.0183669775724411,-0.12183848768472672,0.02401190996170044,0.012174127623438835,-0.04503217339515686,0.01879015564918518,-0.00710524944588542,0.07922877371311188,-0.029166733846068382,-0.0040686787106096745,0.05220915749669075,-0.0596059150993824,0.0362689383327961,-0.015950974076986313,-0.07450126856565475,0.023760264739394188,-0.09421619027853012,0.05807538330554962,0.02684197761118412,-0.05870554968714714,-0.03980308398604393,0.02015489526093006,-0.11735381186008453,-0.0689718946814537,-0.09865295141935349,0.05600254237651825,0.027161255478858948,0.10611223429441452,-0.0031237443909049034,-4.524444328194383e-33,-0.014814467169344425,-0.020049793645739555,0.03468477725982666,-0.0416676327586174,0.05297420546412468,-0.07823909819126129,-0.05994373932480812,-0.11481297761201859,0.05957602709531784,-0.0380408838391304,0.013287970796227455,-0.051950328052043915,0.05643532797694206,0.055764324963092804,-

{"title":"Identifying the long-term effects of maternal immune activation in offspring","abstract":"There is growing evidence that immune perturbations in the developing CNS can influence neurodevelopment and influence the individual's risk for CNS-related disorders throughout life. In particular, there is strong epidemiological evidence that maternal immune activation (MIA) during early to mid-gestation is associated with increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia in the offspring. However, the molecular mechanism of how MIA impacts neural function and behavior is still unclear. To tackle this challenge, our lab and others have developed mouse models to investigate MIA-induced phenotypes and elucidate the mechanisms by which an early event during pregnancy could induce lasting impacts on the offspring's neural outcomes. Here, we combined high dimensional transcriptional analysis with histological methods and behavioral assays to determine how changes in transcriptional and cellular profiles relate to functional consequences. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how MIA predisposes an offspring to neurodevelopment and neuropsychiatric disorders could allow for targeted therapeutic interventions in the clinic.  In this dissertation, I present work characterizing the mechanisms by which MIA influences both early neurodevelopment as well as responses to environmental and genetic insults later in life. In chapter 2, I demonstrate that MIA through TLR-3 versus TLR-4 signaling results in distinct placental and fetal outcomes during development. In chapter 3, I identify long-term transcriptional changes following prenatal immune challenges that subsequently impact neuroinflammatory responses in adulthood. In chapter 4, I elucidate how gene-environment interactions between ASD risk genes and MIA can exacerbate placental and neural phenotypes. Collectively, this dissertation thesis presents fundamental molecular insights into MIA mechanisms with the ultimate goal of understanding how prenatal immune challenges impact brain function and human health.","vector":[-0.07397879660129547,-0.051455605775117874,0.01836313307285309,0.04348108544945717,0.08087915182113647,0.13639217615127563,-0.014711019583046436,0.028001820668578148,0.005818469915539026,0.04933326691389084,-0.06247662380337715,-0.060937218368053436,-0.04570725932717323,0.012458313256502151,-0.03866250813007355,0.14749674499034882,-0.04535682126879692,0.04540545493364334,-0.025814224034547806,0.01927069015800953,-0.03575042262673378,-0.04664083942770958,-0.0018248209962621331,0.010937506332993507,0.006988234352320433,0.048834607005119324,0.04796846583485603,0.016727132722735405,-0.02516232803463936,0.0014952020719647408,0.015473615378141403,-0.03565548360347748,-0.0274102371186018,-0.015439314767718315,-0.07281927764415741,0.04013991728425026,-0.02935028448700905,-0.015932532027363777,0.029095295816659927,-0.07456344366073608,0.05981741100549698,0.004188113380223513,-0.03379136323928833,0.013072964735329151,-0.018477637320756912,-0.09572982043027878,0.05842593312263489,-0.013858048245310783,-0.055352840572595596,-0.021978218108415604,0.014598868787288666,0.02468952164053917,0.005207703914493322,0.030958283692598343,-0.04077130928635597,0.02733883261680603,0.0010166409192606807,-0.020349763333797455,0.01206272467970848,0.0326368622481823,-0.08052295446395874,-0.039239551872015,0.0018020079005509615,-0.04747716337442398,0.11283125728368759,0.05334211140871048,-0.0012748242588713765,-0.012250293977558613,-0.11801046878099442,-0.0508924201130867,-0.043546151369810104,0.05271231383085251,-0.018164129927754402,0.0829024612903595,0.07704518735408783,0.05960157886147499,0.029855862259864807,0.058648839592933655,0.08716358989477158,-0.07841045409440994,-0.04020637646317482,0.11791923642158508,0.0495554655790329,0.079940564930439,0.05056300014257431,0.03717701882123947,0.006079160608351231,0.02751970663666725,0.020811663940548897,0.04996173083782196,-0.027287518605589867,-0.12278378009796143,0.005484683904796839,0.03223933279514313,-0.005724109243601561,0.04307429865002632,-0.014220893383026123,-0.08400096744298935,0.06752074509859085,0.0214681476354599,-0.019121630117297173,-0.0027333840262144804,-0.04740934446454048,0.09595011919736862,-0.018529759719967842,0.07377191632986069,0.050228018313646317,-0.06749948859214783,-0.06455818563699722,0.033128801733255386,-0.06813912093639374,-0.014066302217543125,-0.028590507805347443,0.03456057608127594,0.027244335040450096,-0.03462821990251541,0.04477900266647339,7.842763443477452e-05,0.10436610877513885,-0.005907649174332619,0.07418081909418106,-0.017543654888868332,-0.009005153551697731,0.021284257993102074,-0.05175153538584709,-0.014655138365924358,-0.06179911270737648,3.591791681888626e-33,0.0009658052586019039,-0.014976399950683117,0.07030122727155685,0.06351038068532944,0.012930568307638168,0.024958444759249687,0.0287432000041008,-0.009024434722959995,0.027696946635842323,0.04210537672042847,-0.08017280697822571,-0.03829709440469742,0.003692126367241144,-0.008020705543458462,-0.0034640668891370296,0.04674588888883591,-0.01082470454275608,-0.06093158945441246,0.04197965934872627,0.006583753041923046,-0.02279333770275116,-0.042854491621255875,0.016977163031697273,-0.03607926517724991,0.053566403687000275,-0.07613881677389145,-0.005244637839496136,0.05879729241132736,-0.06690000742673874,0.020930424332618713,-0.06697877496480942,0.0009344120626337826,-0.02664090320467949,-0.045998528599739075,-0.015548739582300186,0.007365294266492128,0.04233239218592644,-0.07107988744974136,-0.0014401177177205682,0.045629359781742096,0.017468763515353203,-0.007891377434134483,-0.060509469360113144,-0.0834072083234787,-0.02725283056497574,-0.044313155114650726,-0.048443276435136795,-0.09322827309370041,0.035074032843112946,-0.03178202360868454,0.07180916517972946,-0.016355466097593307,0.006829207297414541,-0.026756668463349342,-0.06242843344807625,-0.02907712757587433,-0.06168869882822037,-0.07038318365812302,-0.010161755606532097,0.020730210468173027,-0.009808259084820747,-0.10989505052566528,0.006180406082421541,0.003198301652446389,0.057338569313287735,-0.05318789556622505,-0.006800728850066662,-0.04906579479575157,0.05122997984290123,-0.019002918154001236,0.03633576259016991,0.007845322601497173,0.05174122005701065,-0.06453922390937805,-0.07395897805690765,0.029552919790148735,0.04183432459831238,0.04593896120786667,-0.025919154286384583,0.008747382089495659,0.05218641087412834,0.025885187089443207,-0.018755385652184486,0.038490213453769684,-0.03451726585626602,-0.055958330631256104,0.05043766275048256,-0.002676631323993206,-0.04210759699344635,-0.10397873818874359,0.048034582287073135,0.0565384142100811,0.016446242108941078,-0.0676581934094429,-0.05533558502793312,-5.614609544090481e-33,-0.061452716588974,0.0029904867988079786,0.011370780877768993,-0.08928515017032623,-0.08426713943481445,-0.04739486798644066,0.023035019636154175,0.045756906270980835,-0.002848934382200241,-0.021415257826447487,0.002089837798848748,-0.05902436003088951,0.06745100021362305,-0.0218786

{"title":"A  framework for automated structure elucidation from routine NMR spectra and applications and mechanics of organic reactions in alkali salt media","abstract":"Methods to automate structure elucidation of organic molecules have the potential to accelerate chemical discovery and are critical for the broad application of automated high-throughput experimentation platforms. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful methods for elucidating unknown structures because NMR spectra have a high information content that encodes the local environments of atoms that make up organic molecules. However, the analysis of NMR data requires a trained chemist and even for experts it is often time-consuming and error-prone. The first part of this dissertation describes the development and initial application of a machine-learning-based method to automate small-molecule structure elucidation from 1D NMR spectra.  The use of computers to aid NMR analysis has a long history. Chapter 1 provides an overview of this area, including NMR spectra prediction (the opposite of structure elucidation), computer-assisted structure elucidation (CASE), and efforts to fully automate NMR data analysis and structure elucidation. With this backdrop, Chapter 2 describes a new framework for automated structure elucidation. First, a machine learning model was created that takes experimental 1D 1H and 13C NMR data and a molecular formula as inputs and generates a probabilistic prediction for the presence of almost a thousand substructures. The model was trained on &gt; 100,000 simulated NMR spectra and then validated and tested using a few hundred experimental spectra for relatively small organic molecules. The model is shown to be remarkably accurate for predicting the presence of substructures. An F1 score of 0.803 was obtained for substructure prediction of the experimental test set. It can also annotate the spectra to label the peaks corresponding to specific predicted substructures. Second, a graph generator was developed that takes the substructure probability profile output by the machine learning model and generates a probabilistic ranking of candidate molecular structures (constitutional isomers). Remarkably, for the test dataset of experimental spectra of molecules the algorithm has never seen before, the correct structure was identified 67.4% of the time, and the correct structure was one of the top-ten candidates in 95.8% of the cases. The chapter concludes with an outlook for how to improve and extend the framework to enable structure elucidation of more complex and larger molecules.  The second part of the thesis explores organic reactions under solvent-free conditions in media comprised of alkali salts. Compared to solution-phase reactions, there has been substantially less development of solvent-free reactions and even less so for reactions in alkali salts. These unusual media can enable reaction pathways that are difficult to access in conventional solution-phase systems, providing opportunities to discover new methods that streamline synthesis. Chapter 3 describes the investigation of hydrocarboxylation reactions via the addition of alkali formate to alkenes in alkali salt media at elevated temperatures. Solvent-free conditions for high-yielding hydrocarboxylations were developed for various , -unsaturated alkene carboxylates and a few simple alkenes. Mechanistic studies support a radical-mediated pathway for these reactions. With this insight, alkali formate addition to alkenes was translated to aqueous solution-phase conditions using water-soluble radical initiators.  Chapter 4 describes the addition of hypophosphite to alkenes in solvent-free alkali salts. The addition of hypophosphite shares many similarities with the addition of formate but has a considerably broader substrate scope, including both , -unsaturated carboxylates and unconjugated alkene carboxylates. Mechanistic studies and product distributions are consistent with a radical mechanism, and many of the reactions can be performed under aqueous conditions with radical initiators. Several products that are difficult to obtain with other methods were synthesized, simplifying the synthesis of polyfunctional H-phosphinates. Finally, Chapter 5 discusses several additional solvent-free reactions in alkali salts at an earlier stage of development. Reactions include the addition of acetate to alkenes, the conversation of glycolate to tricarballylate, a multistep cycloaddition between maleate and glycine, and aromatic dehalogenation.","vector":[-0.040329739451408386,-0.04545699059963226,-0.03491850569844246,-0.0035191939678043127,0.06982064247131348,-0.05466111749410629,-0.06019720807671547,-0.013540849089622498,-0.03709667548537254,-0.0597044937312603,0.014509282074868679,-0.027392935007810593,-0.005432016681879759,0.032276302576065063,-0.05505366623401642,0.026134368032217026,-0.06664316356182098,0.03269370645284653,-0.047852523624897,-0.06788920611143112,-0.04866080731153488,0.010822546668350697,0.015877241268754005,0.021471556276082993,-0.0014887881698086858,0.06284218281507492,0.06493916362524033,0.029659654945135117,-0.05210854113101959,-0.08221326768398285,0.14462456107139587,-0.035015132278203964,-0.008802606724202633,-0.04585287347435951,0.027716897428035736,0.01737435720860958,-0.05472741276025772,0.09083439409732819,0.015839867293834686,-0.05642762780189514,0.02040339633822441,-0.03482341766357422,0.061008989810943604,-0.011822877451777458,-0.002632301999256015,0.002712786430492997,-0.05825221538543701,-0.05193311348557472,0.057018231600522995,-0.05503358319401741,-0.006609237752854824,-0.0612647570669651,-0.055019963532686234,-0.0051284232176840305,0.021081238985061646,0.10346002131700516,-0.020717570558190346,-0.05510234087705612,-0.032074224203825,0.0329463966190815,0.06480193883180618,-0.07012830674648285,-0.02366887964308262,-0.01158550102263689,0.011651496402919292,0.026059657335281372,0.09494108706712723,-0.035393472760915756,0.017765725031495094,-0.04657238721847534,-0.0539608970284462,0.03274838998913765,-0.039714738726615906,0.16396395862102509,0.006098534911870956,0.03857393562793732,-0.04266446456313133,0.026231974363327026,0.05283556878566742,-0.012359234504401684,-0.059896670281887054,0.04631130397319794,0.023429911583662033,0.026763329282402992,0.05452709645032883,0.028954803943634033,-0.012259850278496742,0.05309070274233818,0.0010884079383686185,0.02249356545507908,0.029139088466763496,-0.006894688121974468,-0.08518378436565399,-0.08899207413196564,-0.07836107164621353,0.0414823517203331,0.08057405799627304,-0.056702375411987305,-0.007185245864093304,0.03843564912676811,0.05475454032421112,0.08508483320474625,-0.001918656169436872,-0.08526159822940826,-0.041833192110061646,0.02927308902144432,0.08888975530862808,0.04781361669301987,0.049517884850502014,0.01453119982033968,-0.02563789300620556,0.08743739128112793,-0.01138077862560749,-0.06747666746377945,0.031087107956409454,0.021092956885695457,0.019467966631054878,-0.01852482743561268,0.03366837650537491,0.03108374960720539,-0.03440798819065094,-0.0065232133492827415,-0.010377738624811172,0.04570407047867775,0.03179849684238434,-0.03908407688140869,-0.1515026092529297,1.6712405425113634e-33,0.027806956321001053,0.03546702489256859,0.03690793737769127,0.03709128126502037,0.004564965143799782,-0.06855814158916473,-0.024567069485783577,0.020402956753969193,-0.052639272063970566,0.06725815683603287,-0.028643470257520676,-0.060858942568302155,0.020055251196026802,-0.026454472914338112,-0.02169259637594223,-0.0022712836507707834,0.015123363584280014,0.004783140029758215,-0.030887724831700325,-0.120476134121418,-0.060320913791656494,-0.016995051875710487,0.003710541408509016,0.017064355313777924,-0.03668266534805298,0.015497282147407532,0.00824667140841484,0.019903412088751793,-0.040646545588970184,-0.014088395982980728,-0.00637065339833498,-0.004278200678527355,-0.10859859734773636,0.06489644199609756,0.0855751782655716,-0.05016598105430603,0.02997419610619545,0.01491872500628233,0.052191708236932755,-0.06197250261902809,0.030725033953785896,-0.01635708101093769,0.059187572449445724,0.003848719410598278,-0.05280865356326103,0.054716046899557114,-0.002909250557422638,-0.05041026324033737,0.012420241720974445,-0.048865433782339096,0.05923981964588165,-0.06886406242847443,0.005161675624549389,0.014905746094882488,-0.03536130115389824,0.10698357224464417,0.02380608767271042,0.011653974652290344,0.03794101998209953,0.028639324009418488,-0.02230987697839737,0.06002894043922424,-0.030410898849368095,0.06913812458515167,0.037929195910692215,0.023978276178240776,-0.04489250108599663,-0.009970094077289104,0.04315556213259697,0.05249592661857605,0.04816719517111778,0.03833197057247162,0.04842140153050423,-0.03554924204945564,0.1003991961479187,0.006180026568472385,0.004115068819373846,-0.049623504281044006,0.059958361089229584,0.06997822970151901,0.01397861447185278,0.05673368275165558,0.04732770472764969,-0.04873017966747284,-0.10281512141227722,-0.03682663291692734,0.03610359504818916,-0.07961562275886536,-0.02209930494427681,0.005607968661934137,-0.03730553016066551,-0.03583637624979019,0.02455819398164749,-0.06437904387712479,-0.03473891317844391,-3.390310480789747e-33,0.04230472072958946,0.009193232282996178,0.11431773006916046,-0.01825616881251335,0.014355710707604885,-0.03493061289191246,-0.08751840889453888,0.03176652640104294,-0.00790709163993597,-0.07356120645999908,0.09839140623807907,-0.03212457150220871,0.015220812521874905,-0.08165447413921356,0

{"title":"Electronic interactions across vacancies in halide perovskites","abstract":"This doctoral research made use of high-pressure techniques and compositional substitution to rationally modify the structures of a subset of halide perovskites, called halide double perovskites. These structural modifications impact the light absorption and electrical conductivity properties of halide double perovskites, enabling the observation of structure--property relationships across a series of structural modifications. Of particular interest was the use of high-pressure lattice compression to strengthen the degree of orbital interactions across crystallographic vacancies. This research interest led to the study of the high-pressure properties of Cs2AgITlIIIBr6, Cs2SnIVBr6, Cs2PdIVBr6, Cs2TeIVI6, Cs2SnIVI6, and Cs4SbIIISbVCl12. In several cases, compression of halide perovskites with vacancies results in greater than 100,000,000-fold increases in electrical conductivity as well as large decreases in the onset energy of light absorption. In Cs2AgTlBr6, the high-pressure variations in conductivity are understood as tuning of the ionization energy of the bromine vacancy defect, while the changes in bandgap are rationalized with relative strengthening and weakening of orbital interactions that give rise to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum. In Cs2SnBr6, Cs2PdBr6, Cs2TeI6, and Cs2SnI6, alternating B-site vacancies are preferentially compressed at high-pressures such that the evolution of conductivity and bandgap can largely be related to across-vacancy orbital interactions of [SnBr6]2--, [PdBr6]2--, [TeI6]2--, and [SnI6]2--, respectively. Furthermore, Cs4SbIIISbVCl12 exhibits intervalence charge transfer that corresponds to electron transfer from [SbIIICl6]3-- octahedra to [SbVCl6]-- octahedra across a B-site vacancy. The thermal and optical energy barrier to intervalence charge transfer in Cs4SbIIISbVCl12 decreases rapidly at high pressures, eventually leading to an absorption onset below 0.08 eV, electrical conductivities above 1 S·cm--1, and activation energies below 30 meV. We tentatively assign the electronic structure above 33 GPa as Cs4SbIVSbIVCl12, corresponding to non-distinct Sb sites and non-metallic conductivity arising from rapid electron exchange facilitated by compression. Lastly, the electronic dimensionality of Cs2SnI6 was probed by manipulation of the distances between [SnI6]2-- octahedra. Pressures up to 8 GPa decrease the across-vacancy I--I distances by ca. 14% while maintaining the cubic structure. Alternatively, large substitution of the Cs A-site with increasingly bulk organic cations induces separation of the [SnI6]2-- octahedra. Analysis of the bandgaps and absorption onsets at high-pressure and across the series of A2SnI6 demonstrates that across-vacancy interactions in Cs2SnI6 are responsible for reducing the bandgap from ca. 1.5 eV to ca. 1.3 eV. At high-pressures, these across-vacancy interactions are considerably strengthened, reducing the bandgap to ca. 0.8 eV. Taken together, this work on halide perovskites with vacancies demonstrates that orbital interactions across vacancies are active at ambient pressure and are readily strengthened at high pressure,

{"title":"Developing multiscale models of conjugated polymer morphology and transport","abstract":"Conjugated polymers (CPs), polymers with backbones of alternating single and double bonds, can conduct electricity yet remain lightweight, flexible, optically transparent, and biocompatible. With this attractive combination of properties, CPs have the potential to transform devices for clean energy generation and storage, computing, and personalized health. However, CPs cannot currently meet the full range of performance requirements in many of these demanding applications, while the intrinsic disorder in CP morphology frustrates experimental efforts to characterize film microstructure and to elucidate the structure-function relationships necessary for rational device design. Computational and theoretical techniques have the resolution to probe these microstructural details, but the reliance on generic models, which do not capture important chemical details underlying CP flexibility, has limited their ability to investigate CP morphology. I seek to extend generic models to capture these details, creating a reliable foundation to study the influence of CP structure on device morphology and transport.  Generic molecular dynamics (MD) models commonly used to study CP film and solution microstructure were not trained on CPs, yet their extrapolation to CP systems has not been validated. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations can reliably model CP flexibility, but the plethora of density functionals (DFs) are empirically formulated and are not all accurate for every system. Thus, I completed two projects to improve MD models of a popular CP system, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). First, I benchmarked several DFs against high-accuracy ab initio predictions of CP flexibility. I found that electron localization induced by Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange systematically influences these predictions: DFs which balance HF with other contributions to the DFT Hamiltonian, such as ωB97x-D, provide better predictions. Then, I used ωB97x-D to parameterize an MD force field (FF) for PEDOT in undoped and highly doped states. These FFs are more accurate than the generic models and capture the effect of doping on CP flexibility.  Accurately representing PEDOT:PSS microstructure proves to be foundational to understanding charge transport (CT) mechanisms in the material. In experiment, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with a PEDOT:PSS channel exhibited an exponential decay of the mobility with increasing PSS loading, which existing percolation-based and effective-medium CT models could not explain. In a collaborative effort, I helped develop a model proposing that holes tunnel between isolated PEDOT chains in the PSS-rich phase, giving rise to macroscopic CT. Our multiscale CT model, using the optimized MD FF to represent film microstructure, replicates the observed mobility scaling. Thus, the ion-conductive phase in OECTs, traditionally understood as electrically insulating, is in fact a barrier to tunneling and therefore plays a critical role in CT. We demonstrate that the choice of ion-conducting material influences tunneling rates, suggesting a new relationship to guide future design of OECTs and other CP devices.  Statistical polymer models, such as the wormlike chain (WLC), permit the study of polymer behavior over longer length and time scales than atomistic simulation, but existing models fail to capture the anisotropic bending present in CP chains and CP melt morphology. To introduce this anisotropy, I created a generalized WLC model called the ribbon-like chain (RLC) and solved the RLC free-chain Green's function. The Green's function solutions can calculate single-chain statistics such as tangent autocorrelations, the radius of gyration, and chain shape, and clearly demonstrate the influence of anisotropic bending on these properties. When the RLC model is applied to MD simulations of CP melts, the chain statistics also highlight anisotropic bending and are reflective of CP structure. Thus, the RLC model can better examine the relationship between CP structure and melt morphology.  Altogether, this dissertation advances models of CP morphology and transport by incorporating chemical details influential on the conformational behavior of CPs.

{"title":"Narrating war in modern Japan : dispatched journalism, written style, and narrative authority","abstract":"This dissertation investigates the specific ways that ideologies of modern literature, nation, and self are articulated, contested, and negotiated in the war correspondence of Japan's Meiji period (1868-1912). Though we usually think of journalism and literature as separate spheres, the ideologies of modern literature, nation, and \"the news\" are intermixed. This is true the world over, but all the more true in the case of Japan. Newspapers and reportage first emerged and flourished in the Meiji period, just when fierce debates were raging over the relationship between literature and lived reality as well as over the \"proper\" form that a national Japanese literature should take. It was in this context that modern Japanese ideologies of national community, journalism, and literature became inextricably imbricated. The work of dispatched and embedded war correspondents provides a novel lens through which to examine this imbrication. The Meiji period was punctuated by military expeditions of successively increasing scale and intensity (the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the Taiwan Expedition of 1874, the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877-78, the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05), each of which was accompanied by a growing volume and variety of news coverage. One of the few constants in this maelstrom was the war correspondent's report: each of the military actions above produced serialized accounts from newspaper reporters traveling with Japan's forces. These reporters included not only canonized authors of modern fiction and poetry and pioneers of Japan's first Western-style newspapers, but also countless others whose names have been largely absent from histories of modern Japan. By treating the work of figures from all of these categories as a unified discursive field, this project challenges the boundaries of canon in literary and journalistic writing and reveals the underlying connections between the two fields of endeavor. Furthermore, I suggest that this shared discourse established a dialectic relationship between conceptions and practices of literary and journalistic narration in modern Japan, through which authority and national identity were not only gradually articulated, but also relocated and rendered transparently \"natural\" in the form of the narrating modern subject. The dissertation consists of two broad parts comprised of two chapters each for four chapters in total.  Part One covers the first decade of the Meiji period, examining the still tightly related forms of newspaper writing, kanbun kundoku, and the gesaku written tradition. This period is marked by both tension and melding between elite and vulgar written forms, with the historical rupture of the Meiji Restoration and the ongoing massive reorganization of laws and society providing the possibility of a similar upheaval in the order of language. Chapter One centers on Kanagaki Robun and his 1874 work Saga denshinroku. Robun melds elite and vulgar discourses and written modes in the compilation of his history, patterning himself after the elite Fukuzawa Yukichi and proclaiming his dedication to contributing to \"public history\" even while he formats Saga denshinroku as a traditional e-iri yomihon and includes generous helpings of familiar moral didacticism. Despite this seeming tendency toward pastiche, however, I argue that Saga denshinroku should be understood primarily as a genuine attempt to put the style of the Edo yomihon to work at contributing to elite discourses, as an attempt to elevate the gesaku written mode to something much more credible and authoritative than it had been considered before. The attitudes and themes that Robun develops over the course of the text's composition inform and anticipate his oft-mentioned \"return to gesaku\" several years later. Chapter Two centers on Senpō sairoku, the dispatched reporting of Fukuchi Gen'ichirō in the Seinan War. I argue that a new narrating subject emerges as a result of the stylistic techniques Fukuchi gradually develops. Anchoring national-level events and ideas within a first-person personal narrative, this narrator combines authority and status (established by way of the real-life Fukuchi's experiences and his close access to war command and the Meiji government) with an ability to be personally sympathized or even identified with by readers. This was to become the model approach to dispatched reporting in modern Japan.  Part Two of the dissertation covers the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05). This section of the dissertation focuses in on the ways that the two discourses of \"journalism\" and \"literature\" remain in close contact, even as they begin increasingly to be conceived of as separate fields of endeavor. Chapter Three takes up the dispatched reporting of Kunikida Doppo for the Kokumin shinbun in the Sino-Japanese War. Posthumously collected and published under the title Aitei tsūshin, Doppo's reporting rejects the conception — already prevalent in the 1890s — of the war correspondent as objective observer and reporter of fact. Instead, Doppo seeks initially to poetically evoke the experience of being at sea far from home. On the one hand, this focus on lyricism and natural description serves as a grounds to develop and practice the written style which Doppo would put to use in much of his later fiction. Simultaneously, however, the narrative shifts in tone and written style. Read in sequence, these shifts describe a kind of narrative arc, whereby the romantic but callow poet is awakened to the grand ideas of nation and war. I examine the ways that Doppo's written personae are performed and inscribed to reveal how conceptions of individual subjectivity articulated through written style intersect with consciousness of nation and national identity in the reporting of modern Japan's first foreign war. Chapter Four examines Tayama Katai's reporting in the Russo-Japanese War. I consider Katai's war narratives in relation to his literary theories, on the one hand — particularly February 1904's Rokotsu naru byōsha — and to his journalistic writings on the other, especially the travel writing that he was known for. Katai's dispatched reporting is much more indebted to the latter than the former. I suggest that for Katai, journalism and literature had become completely severed, functioning as two entirely distinct modes of written practice. Nonetheless, the reworking and rewriting of Katai's war narratives reveals how Katai paradoxically considered his reporting experience as the means for collecting material to be turned into great art. Katai's journalistic writing also provides a critical context for understanding the ways that Katai's canonical \"literary\" writings were particularly open to a certain kind of biographic reading,

{"title":"Scattering studies of magnetic and charge correlations in two-dimensional quantum magnets","abstract":"The study of quantum magnets in two-dimensional systems is a forefront field in both materials science and condensed matter physics research. Such materials not only provide rich platforms for potential applications of novel materials but also further our understanding of basic physics. Neutron and x-ray scattering are powerful tools to explore the magnetic and charge correlations in these materials. This thesis describes the experimental investigation of two model systems in bulk crystalline form, one with a two-dimensional kagome lattice and one with a two-dimensional square lattice, both consisting of Cu2+ ions with spin-1/2. Strong quantum fluctuations give competing ground states or phases in both systems.  Recently, barlowite Cu4(OH)6FBr has attracted much attention as the parent compound of a new kagome quantum spin liquid candidate. Our new synthesis method produced large single crystals of a new variant of barlowite, which has a higher symmetry space group compared to the previously reported one. Our elastic magnetic neutron scattering measurements reveal that the magnetic ground state of the new high-symmetry barlowite at low temperatures has a special pinwheel q = 0 magnetic order. In the intermediate temperatures, our numerical calculations and inelastic neutron scattering indicate that the kagome spins are in a potential pinwheel valence bond crystal state. Both of the two ground states are in close proximity to the long-sought quantum spin liquid state. The second part of my thesis is focused on the spin and charge correlations in high-Tc cuprate superconductors. Cuprate materials display intriguing physical phenomena due to the coexistence of various phases, which may interact with the superconductivity. The La-based family is a canonical example where both the spin and charge correlations could form \"stripes\". Magnetic neutron scattering reveals a rather surprising feature of the spin stripes in the model material La1.88Sr0.12CuO4: regardless of whether they are static or fluctuating, these stripes are always tilted from the high-symmetry direction of underlying lattices. Comparison with numerical simulations reveals the important role of the next-nearest neighbor electron hopping. Resonant soft x-ray scattering measurements offer important information about the charge order in another cuprate material stage-6 O-doped La2CuO4+y. By tuning both temperature and the dopant disorder level, we clearly observe two types of charge orders with distinct correlation lengths and behaviors at low temperatures.

{"title":"A  p53 super tumor suppressor reveals fundamental roles of p53 in lung cancer and regeneration","abstract":"p53 is critical for tumor suppression. This is evidenced by (1) the fact that the TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, (2) patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, who inherit a copy of mutant TP53 nearly all develop cancer in their lifetimes, and (3) mice that lack the Trp53 gene develop cancer with complete penetrance. p53 is especially important for suppression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a deadly cancer in that originates from alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells in the lung in which TP53 is mutated in almost half of cases and is correlated with a worse prognosis. However, we have a limited understanding of the downstream gene expression programs and functions regulated by p53 that are critical for LUAD suppression. In this dissertation, I describe the work that led to the discovery that a p53-directed alveolar regeneration program underlies lung tumor suppression. Using genetically engineered mouse models of LUAD with an allelic series of p53, including loss-of-function and gain-of-function alleles, I first deciphered the contribution of p53 at different stages of LUAD development and uncovered dual roles for p53 in suppressing LUAD initiation and progression. Using transcriptomic and epigenomic approaches, I then identified that p53 promotes the presence of a lung and alveolar cell program in LUAD. Specifically, I discovered that p53 induces an alveolar type 1 (AT1) differentiation program in both mouse and human LUAD. Moreover, this program is directly induced by p53, with p53 expression leading to the binding, opening of chromatin, and transcriptional activation of numerous AT1 genes. This induction occurs after p53 is activated in a high-plasticity, transitional cancer cell state. p53 limits the expansion of these transitional cells through restricting gene expression programs that promote tumor progression and instead promoting an AT1 differentiation program. This AT2-to-AT1 switch through a transitional intermediary is reminiscent of an alveolar regeneration program in which AT2 cells enter into a transitional state en route to AT1 differentiation. I found that the similarities extend beyond this to include a p53-directed AT2-to-AT1 program, in which, after alveolar injury, p53 restrains initial AT2 self-renewal and, after cells enter the transitional state, p53 promotes their differentiation to AT1 cells. These studies show a p53 functions in regeneration underlie tumor suppressive programs. Finally, I analyze the contribution of p53 transactivation domains to gene expression programs and functions in LUAD suppression using a system with temporal control of p53 activation. I find that p53 transactivation function is required for tumor suppression and define the unique programs and cellular phenotypes associated with each transactivation domain.

{"title":"Goldi-ox : mixing metals and valences in halide perovskites","abstract":"Throughout my PhD, I have explored and expanded the vast and diverse class of metal-halide perovskites. These extended semiconducting solids can be prepared by aqueous syntheses at near-ambient temperatures and offer myriad applications, the most prominent of which is as high-efficiency solar absorbers in photovoltaic cells. My work has focused on understanding and controlling the optical and electronic effects of combining different metals and distinct oxidation states of the same metal in both known and novel halide perovskites. The perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 represents one promising nontoxic alternative to the toxic Pb-based perovskites, such as (CH3NH3)PbI3, but it has a large bandgap energy that makes it impractical for use as a high-efficiency single-junction solar absorber. I showed that mixing Sn into Cs2AgBiBr6 reduced the bandgap in a fully nontoxic composition. Using a host of experimental techniques complemented by calculations, I uncovered the structural, electronic, and optical consequences of the complex mechanism of Sn substitution in Cs2AgBiBr6. This study demonstrated the ability to tune the electronic structure of perovskites by mixing metals in a nontoxic composition, opening the door to a wider diversity of methods to manipulate the electronic structures of perovskites. I expanded the family of halide perovskites by discovering and characterizing the new family of gold-cage perovskites, an unprecedented structure with no known analog. This structure, with the general formula Cs8AuIII4MIIIX23 (M = In3+, Sb3+, Bi3+; X = Cl-, Br-, I-), combines zero- and three-dimensional sublattices and features ordering of the homovalent Au3+ and M3+ metals, a rare phenomenon only observed in one other halide perovskite. Furthermore, I demonstrated that the visible light absorption could be tuned across a wide range by changing the M3+ metal and by mixing in Au1+. This work added a new member to the impressive array of halide-perovskite structures and demonstrated tunability of the electronic structure, thereby helping to solidify the promise of studying unique perovskite structures. I further diversified halide perovskites with new structure types that stabilize unusual oxidation states of metals in well-defined mixed-valence solids that are stable to ambient conditions. In addition to rigorously confirming the oxidation state assignments using a slew of characterization techniques, I investigated the optical, electronic transport, and magnetic properties of these unique perovskites.

{"title":"Regulating data privacy in the age of surveillance capitalism : the making of the European general data protection regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act","abstract":"Drawing from original interviews with the lawmakers, archival materials, internal emails, and other primary and secondary sources, this dissertation presents a comprehensive, comparative case study of the legislative histories of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It explores the role of institutions, business interest groups and civil society, as well of individual policy entrepreneurs in the policymaking process and explains their ability to pass the world's two strictest privacy laws despite significant push-back from powerful tech giants and other business interests. The dissertation identifies three common factors in the GDPR and CCPA policymaking process. First, both laws were influenced by the presence of foreign elements. In the GDPR case, American tech giants were direct participants through their extensive lobbying in the European institutions. Their lobbying, perceived as aggressive, nontransparent and self-serving, backfired and allowed privacy advocates to frame the need for the GDPR to protect Europeans from their public-private surveillance. Conversely, for the subsequently enacted CCPA, the GDPR served both as a sample for legislative transplant and also as a case in point that comprehensive data privacy laws are possible and will not \"break the Internet.\" Given that many California-based tech giants had to comply with the stricter GDPR standards, the CCPA has also arguably received less resistance than it would have without the GDPR. Second, both the GDPR and CCPA proponents benefited from exogenous events, major scandals related to the collection and use of personal information. For the GDPR process, that scandal was Edward Snowden's revelations about a massive US surveillance program based on the data collected by US-based tech companies. For the CCPA, the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that personal data from millions of Facebook profiles was used without consent for political advertising and amplified the concerns about implications of individual data privacy violations on democratic process. Both scandals made the arguments against a data privacy law politically unpopular. Third, this dissertation highlights the increasingly important role of underdog policy entrepreneurs, individuals outside of traditional lawmaking institutions or organized interest groups in promoting policy change.","vector":[-0.033089302480220795,-0.019172877073287964,0.00473171379417181,-0.0696130320429802,0.0517120286822319,0.03223608806729317,0.04860714450478554,0.018640417605638504,0.01951894536614418,-0.027704887092113495,0.034187864512205124,0.02966575138270855,0.01075919158756733,-0.044503118842840195,0.043823204934597015,-0.01903517358005047,-0.006995569448918104,-0.09457016736268997,-0.08183185011148453,0.052689485251903534,-0.03191077336668968,-0.04076050966978073,-0.04459184780716896,0.04647723212838173,-0.06122055649757385,0.0029614458326250315,0.030897410586476326,-0.13307256996631622,-0.053319647908210754,-0.014028983190655708,-0.016236403957009315,0.007001250982284546,0.036183763295412064,0.06251277029514313,0.054546937346458435,-0.0984676405787468,0.004887262359261513,-1.9208826415706426e-05,-0.07189161330461502,-0.02815769985318184,0.03809651732444763,-0.11164311319589615,-0.075639508664608,0.01579977385699749,-0.025378024205565453,0.07904279232025146,0.10417963564395905,0.014594701118767262,-0.09256085753440857,-0.01265533547848463,-0.07406191527843475,0.003904445795342326,0.03805888071656227,0.04332614317536354,0.00914132222533226,-0.11625108122825623,-0.003805424552410841,0.03539026528596878,0.03718472272157669,0.03562472388148308,0.013113726861774921,-0.06363622844219208,-0.014357915148139,-0.0020527963060885668,-0.00392230274155736,0.09746000170707703,-0.012035226449370384,-0.003042216645553708,-0.045642971992492676,-0.01616397313773632,-0.041102807968854904,-0.024248402565717697,-0.032882317900657654,0.07640977203845978,0.01052535604685545,-0.12145739793777466,0.011795636266469955,0.09500254690647125,0.07788209617137909,-0.06683450937271118,0.030085505917668343,-0.006904828827828169,-0.03002597577869892,0.025307083502411842,-0.061440158635377884,0.0002432921901345253,-0.027325177565217018,-0.02613072842359543,0.05055084824562073,-0.012666041031479836,-0.026309218257665634,-0.016661956906318665,0.01093144528567791,0.006888057570904493,0.03525742143392563,-0.05278048664331436,0.029494108632206917,-0.026769859716296196,0.06580738723278046,0.01407664641737938,0.057240165770053864,0.0687561184167862,0.03060016967356205,-0.0013978542992845178,-0.07881191372871399,0.04161202535033226,-0.0390847772359848,0.0005724002839997411,0.03871247544884682,0.1409282386302948,-0.00854765810072422,0.02798670157790184,0.004478143528103828,-0.06339655071496964,0.043606143444776535,-0.09894144535064697,-0.04982713982462883,0.0664135068655014,0.06396600604057312,0.027848800644278526,0.011388164013624191,0.02363228052854538,0.006328966468572617,-0.00662904791533947,0.07308340072631836,0.022104734554886818,-0.08288851380348206,1.0262089789496311e-34,-0.050754647701978683,0.018780503422021866,-0.0821523442864418,0.008117081597447395,-0.019919350743293762,-0.004330646246671677,-0.0293425265699625,0.046952344477176666,-0.0935443565249443,0.020778696984052658,0.026691390201449394,0.04670916870236397,0.05607522651553154,0.06875750422477722,0.06327211856842041,0.0635945275425911,-0.0455385260283947,0.006611822172999382,0.07801809906959534,-0.012866545468568802,0.07300233840942383,-0.007242924068123102,0.07852504402399063,0.04454085975885391,0.033728983253240585,-0.04590790346264839,-0.02842491678893566,-0.024838129058480263,0.03588610142469406,0.007999040186405182,0.02803802117705345,-0.008235341869294643,0.07775218784809113,0.04656605422496796,0.1372912973165512,0.053190480917692184,0.011517009697854519,-0.0447026826441288,0.05704563856124878,0.009218805469572544,-0.021278543397784233,0.0522584542632103,0.018506139516830444,0.03810741379857063,-0.013523218221962452,-0.013659731484949589,-0.042670052498579025,-0.005375507287681103,0.01218270044773817,0.006864348892122507,0.01385223213583231,0.02632475644350052,0.008554697968065739,-0.09871867299079895,-0.030703529715538025,0.010733653791248798,-0.07243269681930542,-0.06621876358985901,-0.04361577704548836,-0.08337951451539993,0.007460043765604496,0.10283908993005753,0.04390730336308479,0.043416984379291534,-0.0504797138273716,-0.015256140381097794,-0.03222975879907608,0.05994640663266182,0.009502739645540714,-0.06342259049415588,0.03715410456061363,-0.0207509882748127,0.013588531874120235,-0.03069048747420311,-0.012132612988352776,0.02895788848400116,-0.041125208139419556,0.04586191847920418,-0.05237194895744324,-0.07936654984951019,-0.08377469331026077,-0.001045665587298572,0.06006678193807602,0.01810060255229473,-0.07362829893827438,0.05326695740222931,0.027585357427597046,0.04480999335646629,0.036524698138237,0.06660662591457367,-0.06860659271478653,-0.030461320653557777,-0.06685471534729004,0.06314904987812042,-0.03987318277359009,-2.8679575254827857e-33,-0.04613426700234413,-0.06554128229618073,-0.008497504517436028,0.01729210652410984,0.013311940245330334,-0.019904850050807,-0.05563937872648239,-0.08762329816818237,0.09439463168382645,-0.03771575167775154,-0.07393261045217514,-0.06387659907341003,0.0779200866818428,-0.028530370444059372,0.0488911010324955,0.03913

{"title":"Investigating the composition and architecture of insoluble polysaccharide systems and protein interactions","abstract":"Polysaccharides are essential macromolecules found across all life forms. However, they can pose a challenge to solution-based analytical methods due to insolubility, high molecular weight, and close interactions with other biomolecules including proteins. To study these diverse polysaccharides and heterogeneous composites, we leverage solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) to quantify and compare polysaccharide modifications, to determine the composition ratio of protein-polysaccharide mixtures, and to assign novel gene function. Additionally, we develop methods to enable cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) visualization of the architecture of these biologically complex systems.  Here we report on studies of three systems: exopolysaccharides produced by S. meliloti, amyloid-polysaccharide biofilms formed by E. coli and S. Typhimurium, and chrysalides of the Monarch and Swallowtail butterfly. First, we demonstrate how two types of fibers in the bacterial extracellular matrix assemble into an impressive \"basket-like\" architecture and detail our specialized cryo-EM approaches optimized for the unique characteristics of the biofilm. After \"unraveling\" the biofilm baskets, we weave them back together by reconstituting robust biofilms with inter- and intra- species complementation between E. coli and S. Typhimurium. Next, we identify a novel pyruvyltransferase using ssNMR to analyze rhizobial exopolysaccharides. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis of a much larger yet comparable structure to the biofilm extracellular matrix - the butterfly chrysalis - detailing the chitin-rich framework and proteomic

{"title":"Visual computational sociology : computer vision methods and challenges","abstract":"Targeted social and economic policies require an understanding of a country's demo- graphic makeup. Thus, countries like the United States spend more than 1 billion dollars a year gathering survey based census data such as race, education, occupation and unemployment rates. In this work, we explore the use of publicly available digital imagery to measure demographics without the high costs incurred by surveys. These results can then be inputs to critical socioeconomic policies. In particular, we apply computer vision methods to 50 million Google Street View images from 200 cities and show that a wide range of characteristics such as income, education levels, voting patterns, race, CO2 emission per capita and other market research results can be accurately inferred from these images. We specifically use fine-grained image recognition techniques to detect and classify approximately 21.8 million cars and use them to predict demographics. One can imagine using multiple objects such as trees, clothes, houses or people themselves to further extend this analysis and improve its accuracy. However, scal- ing these methods to other objects such as trees, clothes, houses or other objects using current supervised methods is infeasible. Fine-grained datasets are notoriously expensive to collect and it is not possible to annotate images of objects in every pos- sible form they can appear in the world. We present scalable methods of collecting synthetic fine-grained datasets and present an attribute based fine-grained domain adaptation method to perform data efficient classification.","vector":[0.033259302377700806,-0.014034675434231758,0.0327913835644722,0.033909182995557785,0.15050381422042847,0.0401742048561573,-0.018946854397654533,-0.047514479607343674,-0.06307952105998993,-0.03473496064543724,-0.0067940354347229,-0.07214400917291641,0.041607800871133804,0.034136947244405746,0.004661590326577425,-0.02232365496456623,0.06466943770647049,0.07707864046096802,-0.05052679777145386,-0.028560640290379524,-0.011984841898083687,-0.013989495113492012,0.06936287879943848,-0.01001534704118967,-0.00715140113607049,-0.009745540097355843,0.044682275503873825,-0.049452461302280426,-0.058632854372262955,0.012209623120725155,0.06633243709802628,0.04287828505039215,-0.029395753517746925,0.06987360864877701,-0.00440489174798131,-0.030446689575910568,0.045344479382038116,0.05561576038599014,-0.018914641812443733,-0.06921233981847763,-0.02587006986141205,-0.08154004067182541,-0.0428953543305397,-0.02102152816951275,0.05376599356532097,0.057688336819410324,0.08349037170410156,0.0016228349413722754,0.020145462825894356,0.009741733781993389,-0.06492723524570465,0.029346996918320656,0.011814339086413383,-0.0020367675460875034,-0.010340768843889236,-0.03816764056682587,0.021357936784625053,-0.06548619270324707,0.024712031707167625,0.025056635960936546,-0.0016166125424206257,-0.05062974616885185,-0.03616183251142502,0.027040598914027214,0.052063100039958954,0.03119596838951111,0.0035024364478886127,-0.003698116634041071,0.021472852677106857,-0.045745935291051865,0.049175407737493515,0.041103508323431015,-0.013006484135985374,0.01893528364598751,-0.007141807582229376,-0.04769304767251015,0.025146745145320892,-0.00119406811427325,0.07967987656593323,-0.15024033188819885,0.0005504898726940155,-0.04852718114852905,0.011955834925174713,-0.000982580124400556,0.0559074804186821,0.0015834332443773746,-0.07508455216884613,-0.0036563132889568806,-0.01247389242053032,0.002665201434865594,-0.07618456333875656,0.03370218724012375,0.08053950220346451,0.016978764906525612,0.07869399338960648,-0.028794007375836372,0.028776289895176888,-0.10460992902517319,-0.0016442922642454505,0.1001729741692543,-0.06254260987043381,-0.0037788671907037497,0.048096947371959686,0.008489642292261124,0.02297949604690075,-9.463350579608232e-05,-0.0015366080915555358,0.034896742552518845,0.018371224403381348,0.010293962433934212,0.04183753579854965,-0.05141094699501991,-0.06896115839481354,0.04703789949417114,-0.020768726244568825,-0.14130553603172302,-0.007477283012121916,-0.030163152143359184,0.05181213095784187,0.035550057888031006,0.04310036823153496,-0.03019336611032486,-0.03698580339550972,-0.018244333565235138,0.067618228495121,-0.004156732466071844,-0.08653664588928223,1.757487481386156e-33,0.0017476942157372832,-0.0038078699726611376,0.07306729257106781,0.02615870162844658,-0.0632275640964508,-0.021286215633153915,-0.08335401862859726,-0.010145789943635464,-0.022025927901268005,0.060684025287628174,-0.016773972660303116,0.007248395122587681,-0.009321119636297226,0.154452845454216,0.1498723328113556,0.0024295670446008444,-0.0479421429336071,0.04688050597906113,-0.03213224187493324,0.08517391234636307,-0.0647549107670784,-0.035783082246780396,0.04800424724817276,-0.00988159142434597,-0.020481400191783905,-0.020460769534111023,0.0410139262676239,-0.005628146231174469,0.07956869155168533,0.01820208877325058,0.07945635169744492,0.03328200802206993,0.04631103575229645,-0.0035785927902907133,0.018291983753442764,-0.04517519101500511,-0.03707871586084366,0.02508627064526081,-0.015350929461419582,0.03588271886110306,0.010928120464086533,-0.02956835739314556,0.06200065463781357,0.009674296714365482,-0.01258392259478569,0.048009276390075684,0.06121937558054924,0.017607036978006363,-0.06676133722066879,0.08068085461854935,0.08287633210420609,-0.009342407807707787,-0.1264452189207077,-0.06810599565505981,-0.07961265742778778,0.03016767092049122,0.007411210797727108,-0.05255477875471115,0.03472749888896942,-0.09292309731245041,-0.05783494934439659,-0.0028967875987291336,0.029825426638126373,0.036398500204086304,-0.005249657202512026,0.008096728473901749,0.03851080685853958,0.07893936336040497,-0.06692960113286972,0.021367410197854042,0.009616906754672527,0.06450939923524857,-0.005852735601365566,-0.05800542235374451,0.05640656128525734,0.0198704544454813,0.10751990228891373,-0.015187176875770092,-0.04730301722884178,0.039104584604501724,0.03157683089375496,-0.04552212357521057,0.04566814377903938,-0.06341055780649185,0.0207547377794981,0.012215710245072842,0.0013740402646362782,-0.0460408590734005,0.05481227859854698,-0.004390856716781855,-0.059216663241386414,0.020290294662117958,-0.13416071236133575,0.02130538411438465,-0.07602939009666443,-2.2499735129616233e-33,-0.06911925226449966,-0.007230731192976236,0.019017914310097694,0.02544092945754528,-0.03702959418296814,-0.0346745066344738,0.04706336557865143,-0.08272426575422287,0.043179597705602646,-0.001697270548902452,-0.02846093475818634,0.003195580095052719,0.06579554826021194,-0.0

{"title":"Multi-pole NEM relays and multiple-bits-per-cell RRAM for efficient 3-D ICs","abstract":"In this dissertation, I present techniques for improving the power, performance, and area of integrated circuits (ICs) through 3-D integration of two emerging nanotechnologies: (1) resistive random-access memory (RRAM), a non-volatile memory with multiple-bits-per-cell storage capability, and (2) nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relays, nano-scale mechanical relays that can be actuated electrostatically. In modern ICs for edge computing, data movement between on and off-chip memories typically consumes a large fraction of the total power. Dense, non-volatile embedded memory can reduce/eliminate off-chip data movement by keeping frequently-read application data always on chip. RRAM is a good candidate for such a memory, especially because it can store multiple bits per cell, achieving high density on-chip storage. However, efficient and reliable operation with multiple-bits-per-cell RRAM has been a challenge due to (1) stochastic device behavior during programming that results in large pulse counts with traditional write-verify methods, and (2) reliability issues arising from resistance relaxation. Towards the goal of achieving efficient and reliable multiple-bits-per-cell RRAM, I present three contributions: (1) range-dependent adaptive resistance (RADAR) tuning, a fast and energy-efficient programming method for multiple-bits-per-cell RRAM that uses an adaptive combination of coarse- and fine-grained cell resistance tuning, yielding a 2.4x reduction in pulse count over prior methods, (2) characterization of resistance relaxation behavior in three RRAM technologies and analysis of its implications for multiple-bits-per-cell storage, and (3) efficient multiple-bits-per-cell embedded RRAM (EMBER), the first demonstration of a fully-integrated multiple-bits-per-cell RRAM macro. EMBER contains a multiple-bits-per-cell read and write controller with a high degree of flexibility that enables good level allocation (mitigating reliability issues from resistance relaxation) and programming scheme optimization (yielding low-energy, low-latency multiple-bits-per-cell writes). Finally, in reconfigurable ICs, in addition to the memories, the routing fabric consumes a large fraction of the overall area and power. I demonstrate that replacing CMOS routing switches with 3-D integrated multi-pole nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relays in a coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) can achieve 19% lower area and 10%

{"title":"Discovering new functions of the diabetes gene HNF1A in human pancreatic islets","abstract":"The pancreatic islets of Langerhans are mighty micro-organs that dynamically maintain blood glucose in a homeostatic range. Within the pancreatic islets, beta cells secrete insulin and alpha cells secrete glucagon to antagonistically regulate glucose utilization, storage, and production throughout the body. Insulin functions to lower blood glucose levels in the fed state, while glucagon increases blood glucose levels during fasting. The mechanisms that govern insulin and glucagon secretion are complex, and dysregulation of islet cell function can lead to devastating metabolic consequences, including diabetes. While diabetes is classically defined as a disease of insulin insufficiency, growing evidence indicates that dysregulation of glucagon secretion also contributes to hyperglycemia in multiple diabetes subtypes. Namely, inappropriately high glucagon levels have been reported in patients with Type 2 (T2D) and monogenic forms of diabetes, including HNF1A-MODY.  Mutations in HNF1A have been associated with both Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) and increased risk of T2D, and previous studies of monogenic diabetes have informed mechanistic understanding of and therapeutic targets for larger classes of diabetes. Rodent and human stem-cell models have greatly advanced our understanding of pancreatic development and disease. However, heterozygous hnf1a mice do not recapitulate the HNF1A haploinsufficiency phenotypes observed in HNF1A-MODY patients, and stem-cell derived beta-like cells lack certain properties of mature multicellular islets. Thus, there is still a need for models in which to study mechanisms underlying HNF1A-deficient diabetes. Similarly, the mechanisms underlying diabetic phenotypes after extended fasting remain poorly understood. \"Starvation diabetes,\" a state characterized by low insulin levels and hyperglycemia upon refeeding after an extended fast, has been documented in humans and may represent adaptive changes in hormone output from islets to prevent dangerous hypoglycemia during nutrient deprivation. Circulating factors that act on islets to reduce insulin output during fasting and genetic factors that modulate starvation diabetes phenotypes have not yet been elucidated.  In this thesis, we present primary human and mouse models that can be used to discover mechanisms underlying T2D, monogenic, and starvation diabetes. We describe methods for achieving reaggregated \"pseudoislets\" after dispersion of primary human islets, and how pseudoislets are amenable to efficient genetic manipulation while maintaining hallmark features of native islets. Combining the pseudoislet platform with modern genetic approaches, transplantation studies, hormone secretion assays, and chromatin-mapping methods, we identify novel functions of the transcription factor encoded by HNF1A (HNF1alpha) in mature pancreatic beta and alpha cells. Finally, we demonstrate genetic heterogeneity in susceptibility to diabetic phenotypes induced by starvation through characterization of six mouse strains. Overall, these studies reveal a direct mechanistic link between HNF1A loss and diabetic phenotypes in mature human islet cells and provide tools to investigate the mechanisms underlying beta and alpha

{"title":"Migrating money : the social status repercussions of US-Mexico remittances","abstract":"Monetary remittances, the money that immigrants send to their countries of origin, are incredibly important sources of economic support to the Global South. Perhaps due to their economic importance, there has been less work examining the social repercussions of this economic process especially in times of massive demographic change. The US-Mexico remittance corridor is the most consistent and abundant remittance relationship in the world. Contemporarily, it is experiencing dramatic economic and demographic shifts: continuing to break records in the amount of remittance sums that traverse it, the drop to a net zero Mexico to US migration, and finally the increasing feminization of remittance flows. This provides an opportunity to glimpse how changes in the remittance corridor could impact social factors like social status and emotional payoffs that are known to be negotiable via transactions. Using original qualitative and quantitative data sources I examine the question of how monetary remittances impact social status as well as how these impacts differ based on actor characteristics. Drawing on thematic analysis of 30 interviews with related remitters, receivers, and direct relatives in both the US and Mexico, I find that the remitter's gender and the receiver's age are very important to social payoffs. Specifically, I find that women remitters drew a lot of the affective parts of status from their role while experiencing a heavy economic burden. I also find that the cultural norm of deferred reciprocity, where care is cyclical between parents and children, drove which kinds of remittance transactions led to status and affective payoffs and which did not. Finally, I test these trends on a broader quota sample of N=379 Mexican remitters in the US and find that the most robust trend is that of rewarding and emphasizing remitting to young people—with remitters who sent money to the young consistently reporting significant status payoffs. Findings set the groundwork for future work on how remitting impacts how immigrant communities value others and draws attention to how important the receiver's characteristics are to determining status payoffs.","vector":[0.0200914666056633,0.008467190898954868,-0.037789031863212585,0.05713242292404175,0.06455140560865402,0.00886433944106102,0.0238362867385149,-0.022134045138955116,-0.007676292210817337,-0.04080303758382797,0.04835309460759163,-0.041855067014694214,0.05374502018094063,0.020988857373595238,-0.0033866760786622763,-0.005774441175162792,0.03522360697388649,-0.044461145997047424,0.014923397451639175,-0.008332978002727032,0.021282760426402092,-0.09920669347047806,-0.06477383524179459,0.009106339886784554,0.07330767065286636,-0.06323997676372528,-0.008640880696475506,-0.05011315271258354,-0.05183519423007965,0.02665051259100437,0.003811815520748496,0.1509694755077362,-0.06928703188896179,0.02599816769361496,-0.04798064008355141,-0.004558922257274389,0.10361096262931824,0.024779660627245903,0.004124684724956751,-0.0314067043364048,-0.0008715011645108461,-0.0670597180724144,0.05981718376278877,-0.05857774615287781,-0.032603099942207336,-0.050252094864845276,0.09614916890859604,0.013011765666306019,-0.12268075346946716,0.011715324595570564,0.006960148457437754,0.03785691782832146,0.007279458921402693,0.11179707944393158,0.049620892852544785,0.020927276462316513,0.12212986499071121,-0.020057212561368942,-0.0027726588305085897,0.06645048409700394,0.0022071925923228264,0.002965865656733513,-0.026623109355568886,-0.055653706192970276,-0.015541465021669865,-0.05882926285266876,-0.044576991349458694,0.025834888219833374,0.0028626041021198034,0.0074419546872377396,0.046080153435468674,-0.01464016828685999,-0.10177495330572128,-0.014359526336193085,0.02455374412238598,-0.10334081947803497,0.025376109406352043,0.012538711540400982,-0.0967414528131485,-0.005911347921937704,-0.007056102156639099,-0.06208641454577446,-0.03596772253513336,-0.020615428686141968,-0.04468293488025665,-0.026791175827383995,-0.02888982556760311,-0.004562785383313894,-0.007599468808621168,0.04015946388244629,-0.030560974031686783,0.05741259083151817,0.04200448840856552,-0.054858386516571045,0.08590155839920044,-0.018425026908516884,-0.01189321931451559,0.03231315687298775,0.04900643229484558,0.040202341973781586,0.05047917366027832,0.025181425735354424,0.049448128789663315,0.0392366424202919,0.04182422161102295,0.04354356974363327,-0.007601296994835138,-0.004663420841097832,-0.03027885966002941,0.022939438000321388,-0.08428879082202911,-0.0019755412358790636,-0.026271170005202293,0.05492299050092697,-0.04554367437958717,-0.08605761080980301,-0.0001768979855114594,-0.010907847434282303,0.0038040524814277887,0.026470858603715897,0.09433037042617798,0.07805480808019638,-0.06859231740236282,-0.030745424330234528,0.04487055912613869,0.0673002079129219,-0.051429662853479385,3.487883491405705e-33,-0.023747539147734642,0.05465098097920418,-0.02255311794579029,0.035015128552913666,-0.008953924290835857,-0.032483186572790146,-0.09616892039775848,0.033671487122774124,0.030983131378889084,-0.003855648450553417,-0.029352765530347824,-0.02250269055366516,-0.01220223680138588,0.0961369201540947,-0.015885770320892334,-0.02930670790374279,-0.10074789822101593,0.002468568505719304,0.04116304591298103,0.11515496671199799,0.0350152961909771,0.006448078900575638,-0.06665396690368652,-0.005853124428540468,0.027917800471186638,-0.030757179483771324,-0.09728287905454636,-0.03762448579072952,-0.03176642954349518,-0.016908079385757446,0.0013695842353627086,0.07951994240283966,0.07534508407115936,-0.06773338466882706,-0.012856647372245789,-0.046394653618335724,0.04169388860464096,-0.06457789987325668,-0.01490883156657219,-0.09093183279037476,-0.07366764545440674,0.08389154821634293,-0.028903309255838394,0.10413149744272232,0.03363105654716492,0.05403367057442665,0.10529037564992905,0.040350958704948425,0.04727894812822342,0.027685411274433136,-0.052170202136039734,-0.009759943932294846,-0.019153473898768425,-0.09938213229179382,-0.13339047133922577,-0.09434515237808228,-0.021608030423521996,0.03565160930156708,-0.08255884051322937,-0.06383520364761353,-0.038606397807598114,-0.06456445902585983,0.03894905745983124,0.003608138533309102,0.09868420660495758,0.05773734673857689,-0.0016487070824950933,0.010705973953008652,-0.011783168651163578,0.031504034996032715,-0.038719292730093,0.11937147378921509,-0.01857209950685501,0.0231326911598444,0.057350900024175644,0.04103819653391838,0.08993824571371078,0.005168385803699493,0.02364160865545273,-0.029148662462830544,-0.06830625981092453,0.017725756391882896,-0.01627386175096035,-0.054006773978471756,0.06611716002225876,0.015711339190602303,0.03564494475722313,-0.07137715816497803,0.09670833498239517,0.011850778944790363,0.039881087839603424,0.014948638156056404,-0.00304378941655159,-0.01800191029906273,-0.0012229119893163443,-5.616539558877737e-33,-0.11099573224782944,-0.02693556249141693,0.013806362636387348,0.0020454891491681337,0.014517075382173061,-0.024661604315042496,-0.023034632205963135,0.07168448716402054,0.07525260746479034,-0.022032881155610085,-0.03379251807928085,-0.0474386140704155,0.12642262876033783,0.0

{"title":"Removing black boxes in materials science : two-component droplet tilings and distributed manufacturing of fibrous media","abstract":"The interaction of liquids with materials is fundamental to many areas of science, industry, and human health. The first half of this thesis explores how a specific type of liquid (specifically, Marangoni-contracted, two-component liquids) can be used to create a new class of deliberately designed lattice system at the macroscale. The second half builds an experimental context for distributed manufacturing of fibrous materials used in essential products such as face filtering respirators and menstrual pads.  Advances in material fabrication have made it possible to produce materials with an increasing range of geometries, including those with no precedent in nature. However, the relationships between geometry and state or the dynamics governing transitions between states in condensed material systems are not well understood and remain difficult to observe. Here, we have developed a system that exploits the properties of two-component, marangoni-contracted droplets to rapidly explore the properties of systems with novel geometries. In particular, the ability to move in response to vapor gradients over long distances enables the observation of the dynamics of many body systems governed by a non-additive potential energy function subject to non-trivial geometric constraints. The resulting systems are highly frustrated and display relaxation dynamics over two-timescales, a characteristic feature of systems with long-ranged interactions. We show further that the system is amenable to control by a global gravitational field, enabling partial reduction in frustration through the implementation of hysteretic annealing. Finally,  we show that specific geometric configuration can give rise to non-reciprocal interactions, a property common to many non-equilibrium systems but with few artificial realizations.   The availability of many essential products are determined by access to engineered materials. While the production of many materials is highly efficient, this often comes at the cost of robustness, resiliency, and distribution. During the COVID-19 pandemic, production of raw material for personal protective equipment could not quickly respond to surge demand and left many in low and middle income countries without adequate resources. Here, we explored the potential for centrifugal melt spinning for the production of non-woven air filtration media. Meanwhile, access to another essential product, disposable menstrual pads, suffers from many of the same constraints. We develop a mild delignification chemistry for the small scale production of absorbent medium for use in disposable menstrual pads. We show that Agave sisalana,  a drought tolerant succulent that can be grown on marginal land, can be treated under mild conditions to yield an absorbent material with an absorption and retention

{"title":"Efficient learning from 3D molecular structures using equivariant neural networks","abstract":"Deep learning methods operating on three-dimensional (3D) molecular structures show promise in addressing vital challenges in biology and chemistry. The scarcity of experimentally determined structures, however, poses a significant hurdle in many machine learning applications. The incorporation of equivariance into deep learning models, leveraging inherent symmetries in structural biology problems, is essential for efficient learning from limited data. This dissertation delves into the utilization of rotationally and translationally equivariant neural networks in various structural biology problems.

{"title":"Discovery and engineering the TG2/LRP-1 pathway for lysosomal delivery of molecular cargo : implications for celiac disease","abstract":"Celiac disease (CeD) is a systemic, inflammatory immune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine. It is triggered by the consumption of dietary gluten, derived from wheat, barley, or rye in certain genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten peptides are rendered highly antigenic to CeD patients through deamidation at certain epitopes by transglutaminase-2 (TG2), a widely expressed and multifunctional enzyme. Over 95% of all CeD patients express HLA-DQ2, and a vast majority of the remaining population express HLA-DQ8, and in these individuals the deamidated peptides tightly bind MHC-II on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and are then presented to gluten-specific CD4+ T cells. TG2 activity is necessary for peptide deamidation as demonstrated by restoration of a healthy phenotype upon TG2 inhibition in a mouse model of CeD. Thus, understanding the activity and localization of TG2 could help understand the mechanisms underlying CeD, and how APCs take up TG2 and gluten peptides leading to the hallmark T cell response. In my dissertation I discuss a new pathway for gluten antigen uptake and presentation in celiac disease, and how this pathway can be utilized for therapeutic applications. This pathway relies on the protein-protein interactions between three different widely expressed proteins, TG2, α2-macroglobulin and LRP-1. The complex that forms between TG2 and its gluten substrate is recognized by α2- macroglobulin, an abundant plasma protein, which leads to a conformational change. This conformation is recognized by its canonical cell surface receptor, LRP-1, triggering an endocytic event eventually delivering the cargo to the lysosome. In HLA-DQ2 expressing cells the deamidated gluten peptide released in the lysosome binds to MHC-II and is presented on the cell surface. The antigens presented on the cell surface through this pathway efficiently activate gluten-reactive T cells. Finally,  this pathway can be hijacked to induce the lysosomal degradation of proteins of interest. A ligand to the protein of interest is conjugated to a gluten peptide, allowing for the entire complex to be endocytosed in an LRP-1 dependent manner. The molecular cargo, including the protein of interest is degraded, and LRP-1 is recycled to the cell surface. This approach could be used to target therapeutically relevant proteins without needing to inhibit them, in a manner analogous to LYTACs, but using only small molecules. Overall, this work offers insight into the molecular mechanisms behind antigen presentation in CeD, and how this knowledge can be used to design novel therapeutics for CeD and other diseases.","vector":[-0.009441559202969074,-0.10560563206672668,-0.022617889568209648,0.011378158815205097,-0.025889193639159203,0.06142997369170189,0.015861736610531807,0.11511274427175522,0.06491413712501526,0.03380895033478737,0.03851825371384621,0.03683071956038475,-0.06183730065822601,0.04861656203866005,-0.022671520709991455,0.05419602990150452,0.09769047796726227,0.0345112681388855,-0.04679588973522186,-0.15142393112182617,0.025579918175935745,0.0032516983337700367,-0.005788048729300499,-0.01802097260951996,-0.050734009593725204,-0.09725584834814072,0.006462679244577885,-0.011863003484904766,-0.021398020908236504,0.004671913105994463,-0.06033939868211746,-0.054018083959817886,-0.028254572302103043,0.041530560702085495,-0.021190395578742027,-0.00729756336659193,-0.030707068741321564,-0.03639936074614525,-0.02162109687924385,-0.11957582086324692,0.014347324147820473,-0.053962040692567825,-0.07216965407133102,-0.048090334981679916,0.021965455263853073,-0.06912945210933685,0.005561385303735733,0.049743685871362686,-0.004372438881546259,0.043322402983903885,0.06946305930614471,0.033701054751873016,0.002245421288534999,0.0014607234625145793,-0.019911644980311394,0.042687028646469116,-0.05712972953915596,-0.009224512614309788,0.03516117483377457,-0.005474830977618694,-0.06468115746974945,0.00952219683676958,-0.004762257449328899,0.03923672065138817,0.05365850403904915,-0.08360110968351364,0.030662087723612785,-0.01092318445444107,-0.06511686742305756,-0.07233220338821411,-0.08609141409397125,-0.04653856158256531,-0.0006309067248366773,0.05929064378142357,0.06348133087158203,-0.009511074982583523,-0.03229476884007454,-0.02574656903743744,-0.0022634065244346857,0.037188004702329636,0.12031587958335876,0.10864739120006561,0.11626588553190231,0.09075740724802017,-0.021467601880431175,-0.007232239004224539,-0.026146654039621353,0.06716946512460709,0.03279956802725792,-0.09607354551553726,0.08894228935241699,-0.10630444437265396,-0.004669409245252609,0.062189094722270966,0.019750399515032768,0.006527449935674667,-0.013655336573719978,-0.07004733383655548,0.026619115844368935,-0.015164468437433243,-0.09797795116901398,0.019415605813264847,0.013010237365961075,0.016646303236484528,-0.024211032316088676,0.0509723536670208,-0.04302729666233063,0.0760628879070282,0.03513918071985245,-0.03240801393985748,0.04831960052251816,0.026748985052108765,-0.047070667147636414,0.0034719922114163637,-0.02482769638299942,0.05284220725297928,0.0829654261469841,-0.0018187137320637703,0.05439964309334755,-0.01871620863676071,-0.005170729011297226,-0.009044391103088856,0.018781065940856934,0.06298532336950302,0.019497478380799294,0.04290146380662918,0.0071082767099142075,2.9796586924986812e-33,0.03416767716407776,-0.05976981297135353,0.03382428362965584,0.11327572166919708,-0.03237248212099075,-0.060098133981227875,0.025101596489548683,-0.0338357537984848,0.0684441402554512,0.07248052209615707,-0.030550846830010414,-0.05147397518157959,0.023996327072381973,0.0965813472867012,-0.026160873472690582,0.0427037812769413,-0.012425926513969898,-0.07419738918542862,0.014014758169651031,-0.0011427009012550116,-0.07895034551620483,0.06605799496173859,0.07174690812826157,-0.0329480804502964,0.08343418687582016,0.03774178773164749,-0.03742258623242378,0.020852956920862198,0.04523785412311554,-0.022245004773139954,-0.02384990081191063,-0.029862497001886368,-0.0343913696706295,0.05229887738823891,0.05111062899231911,0.06115025654435158,0.0016992738237604499,-0.014723693951964378,0.03727216646075249,0.04600120708346367,-0.029444007202982903,-0.0027839725371450186,0.0021280809305608273,-0.09755443036556244,0.04405442997813225,-0.09204888343811035,0.03425298631191254,-0.04523969069123268,-0.05271443352103233,0.09415140002965927,0.12578457593917847,-0.004592375364154577,-0.014423250220716,-0.003496710676699877,-0.01666014827787876,-0.03406345844268799,0.003384086536243558,-0.005734601523727179,0.030602123588323593,0.06209332495927811,-0.05358932539820671,-0.040953315794467926,-0.0656595230102539,-0.002577119041234255,0.012505684979259968,0.005949928890913725,-0.09640791267156601,-0.057571277022361755,-0.05971565842628479,0.08615367859601974,-0.009209717623889446,-0.04224568232893944,0.0868886262178421,0.01862167753279209,0.04278117045760155,-0.07572012394666672,0.007717215456068516,0.0812978744506836,0.004178926348686218,-0.014337141998112202,0.052905213087797165,-0.014021433889865875,-0.021887876093387604,0.061741627752780914,-0.06210596486926079,-0.055372390896081924,-0.04300832003355026,-0.11196745187044144,0.02735176309943199,-0.07418789714574814,0.05257346108555794,0.12156684696674347,-0.03059546649456024,0.06179981678724289,0.008988702669739723,-5.5380940454015656e-33,0.007836971431970596,-0.023287726566195488,-0.02360612154006958,-0.059924185276031494,-0.061441820114851,-0.015009417198598385,-0.013111128471791744,0.049965932965278625,0.04364284127950668,-0.012939822860062122,0.08807862550020218,0.021408315747976303,-0.06382092833518982,0.00548475

{"title":"A  decision-making model for retired Li-ion batteries","abstract":"This thesis focuses on the development of a decision-making model to determine the solution for a retired battery. The model evaluates the retired battery from both technical and economical perspectives. It integrates a module-level aging model with an economic evaluation model to assess the values of Second Life Batteries for the most commonly cited second-life use cases. Finally, the highest value among different second life applications is compared with the recycling value to determine the optimal strategy for a given retired Li-ion battery. The initial segment of the thesis is dedicated to crafting a module-level degradation model, followed by the integration of an economic model in the subsequent section to project the resale price of used batteries. The thesis reaches its zenith in the third segment with an illuminating use case study, exemplifying the practical application of the decision-making model. Generally, prioritizing reuse over recycling is economically advantageous. However, specific scenarios may render reuse unprofitable, favoring recycling as a more viable option. This dynamic decision-making model adapts to real-world variables, generating varied optimal strategies in response to evolving conditions.","vector":[-0.026436978951096535,0.07892444729804993,-0.05178891867399216,-0.02536262944340706,0.035519544035196304,-0.01572304032742977,0.05024750530719757,0.0759747177362442,0.013756713829934597,0.03768252953886986,0.014771680347621441,0.04243322089314461,0.0810941681265831,0.07283004373311996,0.005265194922685623,0.010245093144476414,-0.026195639744400978,-0.018946051597595215,-0.0537126287817955,0.008618655614554882,0.06349687278270721,-0.035551078617572784,0.0488300658762455,-0.006547420285642147,0.01407663058489561,0.03348046913743019,-0.021647196263074875,-0.011754985898733139,-0.02736675925552845,-0.01563621312379837,-0.013509290292859077,0.1320924460887909,0.02820241078734398,-0.09189263731241226,0.021249717101454735,0.040569331496953964,-0.0727870762348175,0.037049438804388046,0.029387155547738075,-0.026074061170220375,-0.07352524995803833,-0.004278277978301048,-0.014387005940079689,-0.048461005091667175,-0.011410331353545189,-0.027152517810463905,-0.0016005279030650854,-0.033786237239837646,0.009886069223284721,0.05857306346297264,0.055823635309934616,-0.06803394854068756,-0.00713338190689683,-0.05158757045865059,0.050008390098810196,0.0058174957521259785,0.021260106936097145,-0.018124189227819443,-0.00526432553306222,-0.03316245600581169,-0.025888118892908096,-0.04450906813144684,-0.034220680594444275,-0.0058357990346848965,0.011867769993841648,-0.020258678123354912,0.01180436834692955,-0.01756656914949417,-0.06859156489372253,0.018778037279844284,-0.016456352546811104,-0.01481441780924797,-0.06349863111972809,-0.0580642893910408,-0.07266539335250854,-0.01648803986608982,0.15428735315799713,0.010183184407651424,-0.02200331538915634,-0.03873520344495773,0.014513617381453514,-0.00813385657966137,-0.05879011005163193,0.016721686348319054,0.03146698698401451,-0.016442421823740005,0.02050783671438694,-0.03516547381877899,0.12268336862325668,-0.03934739530086517,-0.01665334776043892,0.10819225013256073,0.06935308128595352,-0.012940535321831703,0.021732840687036514,0.08762602508068085,0.006909215822815895,0.048707980662584305,-0.0046822852455079556,0.033130258321762085,0.03109974041581154,0.0174397062510252,0.0743522197008133,-0.06435064971446991,0.02200143039226532,-0.1280023604631424,-0.05682317167520523,0.06314759701490402,0.059252575039863586,0.03790837153792381,0.005569602362811565,-0.056598033756017685,0.047206562012434006,0.017519375309348106,0.033544979989528656,0.05427851155400276,0.0054189725778996944,-0.04015497863292694,0.025676675140857697,0.02654845267534256,0.033550526946783066,-0.032197363674640656,0.06487332284450531,-0.03135202080011368,-0.006322607863694429,0.043973177671432495,0.043837666511535645,1.1306326191136126e-33,-0.13963432610034943,-0.05792433023452759,-0.014338786713778973,0.007622147910296917,-0.059219032526016235,-0.05020076036453247,-0.00550037482753396,0.038411643356084824,0.012930636294186115,-0.055305399000644684,0.039171185344457626,0.08426027745008469,-0.03212055563926697,-0.003800895530730486,0.11098385602235794,-0.011164769530296326,-0.03641996160149574,0.03541923314332962,0.05910759046673775,-0.017358480021357536,-0.05572161450982094,0.004697917029261589,0.057836197316646576,0.019701872020959854,0.09466533362865448,0.0019993751775473356,0.13076841831207275,-0.07080555707216263,-0.05695568770170212,-0.0067388578318059444,0.13535532355308533,0.06491806358098984,-0.08934725075960159,-0.061345845460891724,-0.020143752917647362,0.021761184558272362,-0.019450202584266663,0.07031159102916718,-0.03614940121769905,-0.029897764325141907,-0.09107758104801178,0.06410693377256393,-0.04677475988864899,0.07287797331809998,-0.006589882075786591,-0.05704460293054581,0.06869470328092575,0.017276238650083542,-0.07103303074836731,0.011743455193936825,-0.05459267273545265,-0.021870452910661697,0.008278039284050465,0.0233223345130682,-0.11862275004386902,0.02217942290008068,-0.013208655640482903,-0.07256163656711578,0.015507831238210201,-0.02488400600850582,0.03729720786213875,0.0459681935608387,-0.0029191032517701387,0.03925461694598198,0.03789117559790611,0.055881913751363754,-0.052244823426008224,-0.019015247002243996,-0.009964325465261936,-0.010457397438585758,0.06648430228233337,-0.1270814836025238,-0.016445236280560493,-0.08080276101827621,0.006429022178053856,-0.005162411835044622,0.043011367321014404,0.003260857192799449,0.016885219141840935,-0.1125783622264862,-0.036110203713178635,-0.0125442398712039,-0.061095938086509705,-0.022447697818279266,0.07666976004838943,-0.058761682361364365,0.005255020223557949,-0.05682046711444855,-0.008683834224939346,0.01607038453221321,-0.04679577425122261,0.012177021242678165,-0.0054520550183951855,0.003472581971436739,0.07243934273719788,-2.7193030405098607e-33,0.02590620331466198,0.04583929479122162,0.007697001565247774,0.029307276010513306,0.017485428601503372,-0.058881551027297974,-0.15445519983768463,-0.05883387103676796,-0.007177979685366154,0.002291364362463355,-0.09081939607858658,0.040929269045591354,0.024144288152456284

{"title":"Untouchable : on the cultural politics of hands in Modern China","abstract":"This dissertation explores the representation of touch and tactile culture in modern Chinese literature, film, and visual culture. The project investigates the many powers invested in human hands through narrative, taking a particular interest in the discourses that contribute to the construction of \"untouchable\" people and groups at various historical junctures. I argue that hands and protocols of touch are situated at the crux of major ideological and political tensions from the early Republican era to the new millennium. By examining how contentions about labor, sexuality, modernity, and national survival are played out in discourses of hands, my analysis offers fresh readings of seminal cultural texts and interrogates existing assumptions about intimacy and alienation in the modern era. This project not only contributes to the China field's emerging interest in sensory experience—which has been mostly limited to discussions of visuality, sound, and taste—but also opens up a new vista for sustained future inquiry about how tactility interacts with sight, taste, scent, and sound in a comprehensive aesthetic discourse of the body.","vector":[-0.002451444510370493,0.016599828377366066,0.039276573807001114,0.03843790665268898,0.01988799311220646,-0.021497027948498726,0.1023579090833664,-0.06437637656927109,-0.030392533168196678,-0.030269356444478035,0.0765811875462532,-0.03747178614139557,-0.011945478618144989,-0.003982032649219036,-0.005591762252151966,-0.02539190836250782,0.06227591633796692,0.01183359045535326,0.016030117869377136,0.12515531480312347,-0.005483477376401424,0.006667047739028931,0.09662103652954102,-0.06178626790642738,-0.01935187168419361,-0.07130012661218643,0.0017752267885953188,-0.05728262662887573,-5.479513856698759e-05,-0.030191969126462936,-0.08852682262659073,0.0933327004313469,-0.010972321964800358,0.017951520159840584,0.010888752527534962,0.08356409519910812,0.04294583946466446,-0.07522844523191452,0.013379055075347424,-0.01422704104334116,0.030655555427074432,-0.05729495733976364,0.05244800075888634,-0.044168345630168915,0.06662848591804504,0.05258950963616371,-0.005202429369091988,0.031184259802103043,-0.033968959003686905,0.011036813259124756,0.0024873800575733185,0.033718641847372055,0.08052613586187363,-0.004958014469593763,0.03654131665825844,0.009013851173222065,0.03265537694096565,0.007129112258553505,-0.0450756773352623,0.016171729192137718,-0.02321648970246315,0.05489461496472359,0.00801868550479412,0.034756168723106384,0.04877457395195961,-0.05602362006902695,0.03967653959989548,0.037611912935972214,0.007936635985970497,-0.036164212971925735,-0.06012190878391266,0.021620076149702072,0.04480218514800072,0.006427760701626539,-0.03984984755516052,-0.06392770260572433,-0.04017537459731102,-0.05610507354140282,-0.09602342545986176,-0.11210492253303528,0.0006613309378735721,-0.0055697038769721985,0.07178004831075668,5.101322312839329e-05,-0.10256879031658173,0.006951076444238424,-0.06451873481273651,0.004555594641715288,0.0027852600906044245,0.029350049793720245,-0.07211560010910034,-0.04246718809008598,-0.0617455318570137,0.05387622490525246,0.0637117549777031,-0.02027273178100586,-0.05546886473894119,0.021347006782889366,-0.07629070430994034,0.0206705741584301,0.0029297429136931896,0.04768059030175209,-0.043041568249464035,-0.0015284750843420625,0.012202884070575237,-0.09036778658628464,-0.13062363862991333,-0.061991460621356964,-0.14751003682613373,0.028333522379398346,0.020308660343289375,-0.05951030179858208,-0.05413210019469261,-0.019642705097794533,0.04946654662489891,-0.09847026318311691,-0.014370867051184177,-0.05359428748488426,0.06739716976881027,-0.014566524885594845,-0.0006155665032565594,0.005082870367914438,-0.04900193586945534,-0.05761970207095146,0.004340695217251778,-0.10818979889154434,0.07281341403722763,2.5882480018561493e-34,-0.04430953040719032,0.07396668940782547,0.006604169495403767,0.010370592586696148,-0.012062063440680504,-0.013088757172226906,0.012344065122306347,-0.03306811675429344,-0.08300483226776123,0.005153406877070665,-0.008956776931881905,-0.00928329024463892,-0.07309490442276001,0.015255422331392765,0.030976686626672745,-0.022322600707411766,-0.07920051366090775,-0.03282554820179939,0.06991521269083023,-0.03851033374667168,-0.014623666182160378,0.05778700113296509,-0.01917210966348648,-0.005138019099831581,-0.057717762887477875,0.003980868961662054,0.00886034406721592,-0.02369481697678566,0.037314362823963165,0.017371198162436485,-0.024781787768006325,0.052365392446517944,0.047856736928224564,-0.05202428251504898,0.02914474532008171,0.0573946014046669,0.05370132625102997,-0.038424860686063766,0.01736232452094555,-0.0007152969483286142,0.015081829391419888,0.007196475751698017,-0.028040174394845963,-0.04054804891347885,-0.05480661243200302,0.15909740328788757,0.027290955185890198,-0.030923668295145035,-0.048431988805532455,0.008173062466084957,-0.022632166743278503,0.0008430755697190762,0.09872947633266449,0.050920553505420685,-0.042822930961847305,-0.10561362653970718,-0.02919139340519905,-0.04687605798244476,-0.030424170196056366,-0.08088216185569763,0.021261820569634438,0.016327137127518654,-0.012913597747683525,0.01712864637374878,-0.03838198632001877,0.03913314267992973,-0.03564297407865524,-0.031534187495708466,-0.006868413649499416,-0.0037564937956631184,-0.10917739570140839,-0.004302516113966703,0.0340135283768177,0.02518294006586075,0.013649845495820045,-0.01923411712050438,0.0006684667314402759,-0.06467302143573761,0.019109029322862625,0.013346749357879162,-0.044658176600933075,0.04658579081296921,0.04152153804898262,0.028908969834446907,0.02558891288936138,-0.028466418385505676,0.06942722946405411,0.0005969694466330111,0.05268951505422592,0.02974724769592285,-0.06125945970416069,-0.02496509440243244,0.06551335752010345,-0.0969909131526947,-0.08064668625593185,-1.8802913762165605e-33,-0.0017915628850460052,-0.004106125328689814,-0.04119545966386795,0.10238400846719742,0.004844031762331724,-0.09721449762582779,-0.028555331751704216,0.00825717393308878,-0.025334244593977928,-0.00260558701120317,-0.006850149016827345,-0.04084343463182449,0.078211307525634

{"title":"The  LZ dark matter WIMP search and treatment of fundamental signals","abstract":"While we can observe dark matter gravitationally, we have yet to determine its exact physical properties through non-gravitational means. One of the most historically favored models for dark matter is the weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter experiment seeks to detect WIMPs through the use of a dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC) filled with a 7 tonne active xenon target. LZ published world-leading limits on WIMP-nucleon cross-sections for WIMP masses above 9 GeV/c^2 following its first WIMP search. In addition to summarizing the full WIMP search, this work discusses the development of key efforts including the treatment of fixed and time-varying conditions within both reconstruction and analysis frameworks, studies of high-activity periods likely resulting from fluorescence of the TPC walls, and the development of novel methods to model backgrounds and test analysis cut efficiencies. LZ's future WIMP searches will incorporate a form of bias mitigation known as \"salting\" in which unknown quantities of fake signal events are injected into WIMP-search data. This work discusses the methods used to reliably model, create, and inject fake yet unidentifiable signal events into LZ's data stream. This work concludes with results from the application of autoencoders on PMT waveforms to remove unknown backgrounds.","vector":[-0.09525232762098312,-0.039505477994680405,0.04793671518564224,0.07875697314739227,0.08928638696670532,-0.056634072214365005,-0.035353098064661026,0.052133940160274506,-0.008397961966693401,0.005483570042997599,-0.01338159665465355,-0.09142430871725082,-0.05573601648211479,0.027770835906267166,-0.012429679743945599,-0.03552663326263428,0.11859648674726486,0.004727063700556755,-0.034651581197977066,-0.010645932517945766,0.01616363786160946,0.015252766199409962,0.03441610932350159,-0.009643482975661755,-0.003591870190575719,-0.04212570935487747,-0.017461657524108887,-0.005951103754341602,0.007636327296495438,-0.014513472095131874,0.03363924100995064,0.0243872981518507,-0.011393927969038486,0.048984311521053314,0.03219754621386528,0.02189129963517189,-0.022877901792526245,-0.08801078051328659,-0.017339883372187614,-0.05862324684858322,0.05306236445903778,-0.004665500950068235,0.03306729719042778,0.017086856067180634,0.05208653584122658,0.013644775375723839,0.03203031048178673,-0.037432823330163956,-0.05568782240152359,0.02380894497036934,0.026937397196888924,-0.03933326154947281,-0.017178889364004135,0.09469291567802429,0.0017949641915038228,0.016478165984153748,-0.022619884461164474,-0.07892273366451263,0.04482734575867653,-0.007928320206701756,0.004777237772941589,0.031435709446668625,-0.0472031868994236,-0.032243791967630386,0.07379847764968872,0.026335880160331726,-0.028350232169032097,0.024885037913918495,0.07028941810131073,0.03982334956526756,-0.009903992526233196,0.07458622753620148,-0.04305260628461838,-0.013759966008365154,-0.003819522215053439,0.08191746473312378,0.0407286062836647,0.0006235754117369652,0.04433972015976906,-0.08278201520442963,0.03318604826927185,-0.001219528028741479,0.043217699974775314,-0.04961908981204033,0.030050992965698242,-0.03306109458208084,-0.07699050009250641,0.12442068755626678,0.04087090492248535,-0.01637217029929161,0.038793113082647324,0.014549965970218182,-0.056648723781108856,-0.02066950686275959,0.00868850015103817,0.00784995872527361,0.047670360654592514,-0.002770147053524852,0.071934275329113,0.07809194177389145,0.03605666756629944,-0.008379769511520863,0.06879901140928268,0.048859354108572006,0.01936299353837967,-0.022706206887960434,0.09765292704105377,0.03557821363210678,-0.03304116800427437,-0.0002474116045050323,0.03958650305867195,0.04145452752709389,0.05500001460313797,-0.049602486193180084,0.04542731121182442,0.01707429625093937,0.05289974436163902,0.041549887508153915,-0.12621037662029266,0.02446288987994194,-0.02417384274303913,-0.021527307108044624,0.014710535295307636,-0.005942738149315119,0.05008959770202637,0.12618611752986908,-0.04750324785709381,4.427047274389064e-33,0.08304335922002792,0.019695941358804703,-0.0742415264248848,0.06732993572950363,-0.060829680413007736,0.049396585673093796,0.0493297316133976,0.07890887558460236,-0.10408823937177658,0.07080991566181183,-0.020777815952897072,0.014490260742604733,-0.012059567496180534,-0.009864131920039654,-0.015164028853178024,-0.033041711896657944,0.019037282094359398,0.11137501895427704,-0.0012676409678533673,0.024377109482884407,-0.029752708971500397,-0.045351821929216385,-0.03681919723749161,-0.06954784691333771,0.022036636248230934,0.0791829377412796,-0.00886582862585783,-0.051531918346881866,-0.032228585332632065,0.013770326040685177,-0.045871928334236145,0.04159238189458847,-0.017501747235655785,0.1277713030576706,-0.026747964322566986,0.019714921712875366,-0.08380888402462006,-0.04039493575692177,0.0013336021220311522,-0.11464793235063553,0.02725699171423912,0.062078431248664856,-0.019627975299954414,-0.09606725722551346,-0.039672572165727615,-0.019282059744000435,0.01150366198271513,-0.11559179425239563,0.004002428147941828,0.008369837887585163,0.08239764720201492,0.009054332971572876,-0.08560770004987717,-0.01562638394534588,0.03490627557039261,0.04858945310115814,0.06417869031429291,0.002872928511351347,0.0631212517619133,0.04011758044362068,0.04162096604704857,0.00019811031233984977,-0.050753820687532425,0.03454101085662842,0.01410123985260725,0.038875896483659744,-0.05520164221525192,0.0014508831081911922,-0.047421932220458984,0.022377025336027145,-0.027490312233567238,-0.0781860277056694,0.048739366233348846,-0.048693422228097916,0.04244091734290123,-0.0029106063302606344,0.0751962661743164,-0.02950463816523552,-0.019350122660398483,-0.03807345777750015,0.03759100288152695,-0.006429521832615137,0.0034190260339528322,-0.09163428843021393,-0.08077072352170944,-0.0028512701392173767,-0.04599786177277565,-0.06115645170211792,-0.05646945908665657,-0.13850310444831848,0.03680970519781113,0.036772988736629486,-0.007569707930088043,-0.07978755980730057,-0.10985221713781357,-3.204006381127923e-33,-0.010691408067941666,0.026982706040143967,-0.06857786327600479,0.0652901828289032,0.013781544752418995,-0.032658904790878296,-0.07749450206756592,-0.15104767680168152,0.052769772708415985,-0.003015256254002452,0.09609711915254593,-0.04395715519785881,-0.006736894138157368,-0.06

{"title":"Early childhood educational opportunities under the Kentucky Education Reform Act","abstract":"In this dissertation, I examine how two major social programs in Kentucky -- state-funded preK and Family Resource and Youth Service Centers -- impact children's outcomes across the state, including racial, ethnic, and economic equity through elementary school. In each chapter, I will analyze how early childhood opportunities relate to outcomes including Kindergarten-readiness, including cognitive, language, physical, and socioemotional skills; uptake of preventative health care including early health check-ups, vision screenings, and immunizations; unexcused absences, chronic absence, and discipline in Kindergarten or through elementary school; and performance on statewide standardized math and ELA assessments in Grades 3--5. To do this, I leverage what may be the first statewide, student-level dataset that will permit the linking across preK settings, Kindergarten-readiness, and school outcomes through Grade 3. I look at eight cohorts from the Kentucky Longitudinal Data System from 2013-2014 through 2019-2020, including demographic, academic, health, and service records of approximately 300,000 unique students in preK, comprising 2.3 million student-year observations from preK through Grade 5. This dissertation provides evidence that thirty years after the Kentucky Education Reform Act established state-funded preK and Family Resource and Youth Service Centers, the programs have impacts on equity and outcomes from Kindergarten through Grade

{"title":"Illuminating cellular processes : developing new optic techniques to investigate cellular communication and translational control","abstract":"The human body comprises trillions of cells. Within single cells, complex cellular activities are precisely executed by millions of diverse proteins translated by the ubiquitous translational factory ribosome. How ribosomes control translation of each individual protein within subcellular space therefore dictates the cellular protein landscape at the nanometer resolution. Meanwhile, at the intercellular level, intricate cellular communication is required to coordinate individual cells to perform complex physiological activities. How trillions of cells achieve precise communication through the intertwined signaling network therefore dictates the physiological outcomes at the organismal level. However, direct visualization of these cellular processes has been technically challenging due to the lack of tools with the required spatial resolution. Here, I present novel optical innovations to spatially investigate cellular communication and translational control, respectively. In the first project, I develop an optogenetic toolbox to manipulate cellular communications using artificial myosin motors. Utilizing this toolbox, I am capable of directly probing the molecules transported within long cellular extensions and controlling the dynamics of both filopodia and neurites. I further demonstrate the presence and importance of specialized filopodia in the re-establishment of a Sonic Hedgehog signaling gradient during axolotl limb regeneration. In the second project, I investigate translation control within subcellular space with two orthogonal approaches. Specifically, I develop an optimized expansion microscopy technique to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique to characterize their composition. Utilizing both techniques, I unveil enrichment of the 60S large subunit on the endoplasmic reticulum that is critical for the selective translation of transmembrane proteins. I further discover ribosomal heterogeneity on the mitochondria that is linked to the translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Taken together, these advancements in optic techniques empower us to shed light on cellular processes at different scales with unprecedented resolution.","vector":[-0.013875371776521206,-0.13530153036117554,0.009553995914757252,-0.09123349189758301,-0.06001424789428711,-0.09515462070703506,0.04874672368168831,0.009611930698156357,0.08799564838409424,0.031398285180330276,-0.043410420417785645,-0.0028981242794543505,-0.06433329731225967,0.0812305137515068,-0.03203748166561127,0.07106690108776093,0.016740135848522186,0.06903339922428131,-0.023438023403286934,0.02418435923755169,0.12221407890319824,-0.015464995987713337,0.008422458544373512,-0.015409835614264011,-0.06181253120303154,-0.013746189884841442,0.019394537433981895,0.028026094660162926,-0.04667549207806587,-0.04270165041089058,0.007896979339420795,0.04755531996488571,-0.04465524107217789,0.024980125948786736,-0.04054401442408562,0.035816021263599396,0.017527785152196884,-0.026776988059282303,-0.007518739905208349,-0.05386504903435707,0.08572673797607422,0.012021513655781746,0.043535951524972916,-0.02424733154475689,0.08604609966278076,0.029548747465014458,0.008438426069915295,0.011077692732214928,-0.005632755812257528,0.017204992473125458,-0.0518328994512558,-0.0558663010597229,-0.009263950400054455,0.013603579252958298,0.08101232349872589,0.1456928849220276,-0.03792354837059975,-3.693047983688302e-05,0.05488182604312897,-0.042161110788583755,0.058455292135477066,-0.015095086768269539,-0.023591261357069016,-0.008385533466935158,0.011634244583547115,-0.004667286761105061,0.03685080260038376,0.06130636855959892,-0.027941524982452393,0.04764100909233093,-0.025874946266412735,0.0351828895509243,0.015298261307179928,0.07897541671991348,0.04202483594417572,0.02537696249783039,0.02433887869119644,0.0819234773516655,0.015163611620664597,-0.0446474589407444,0.09034497290849686,0.031441688537597656,0.09342669695615768,0.07321036607027054,0.01823529228568077,0.07256018370389938,0.028638774529099464,0.06370417773723602,-0.049497801810503006,-0.02443038858473301,-0.04526422917842865,-0.03927994519472122,-0.026689760386943817,-0.03668220713734627,-0.06379169225692749,-0.08244084566831589,-0.020688824355602264,-0.04844982549548149,0.002212166553363204,-0.016162382438778877,0.08155722171068192,-0.07739163190126419,0.04508085548877716,-0.03397228196263313,-0.0183258056640625,-0.028799613937735558,0.05683945491909981,0.05599760264158249,-0.0212521031498909,0.1031334176659584,-0.016204746440052986,-0.0006511295796371996,-0.03851772099733353,0.09852415323257446,0.02524758316576481,0.0879301130771637,-0.05048232153058052,0.02776782587170601,0.05026857182383537,0.03329866752028465,-0.03624200075864792,-0.017804933711886406,-0.044325195252895355,-0.0018061603186652064,-0.0390535369515419,0.07107514142990112,-0.024279123172163963,2.362460057140662e-33,0.03928865119814873,0.06832163780927658,0.0240569356828928,0.057385314255952835,0.02383682131767273,-0.01664355956017971,0.020860588178038597,-0.04186910763382912,-0.08397212624549866,-0.030357424169778824,-0.07190030813217163,0.059831179678440094,-0.014044677838683128,0.09948327392339706,0.011852930299937725,-0.10034114122390747,-0.07541966438293457,0.033120185136795044,0.012989645823836327,0.023744169622659683,0.0013473880244418979,-0.005380711983889341,-0.020767949521541595,-0.014943561516702175,-0.008353840559720993,-0.04803330823779106,-0.04455506056547165,-0.036029115319252014,0.06483719497919083,-0.011517172679305077,-0.13230744004249573,0.08260960131883621,0.04686255753040314,-0.03483530879020691,0.06476884335279465,-0.03138319402933121,0.04803912341594696,-0.07344739884138107,0.023517094552516937,0.003264790866523981,0.017830805853009224,0.014030144549906254,-0.03591000288724899,-0.06590356677770615,-0.014977245591580868,-0.0033876181114465,-0.02858698181807995,0.04781416803598404,-0.10405272990465164,-0.04395565390586853,0.01620381325483322,-0.017182696610689163,0.08999980241060257,-0.0747540220618248,0.024893900379538536,-0.026198172941803932,-0.09265081584453583,-0.026485422626137733,0.026207515969872475,0.00485971150919795,0.020855002105236053,-0.09957271069288254,0.014560075476765633,0.0706406906247139,0.05183486267924309,0.07718594372272491,-0.08604252338409424,0.002900288440287113,0.012254692614078522,0.06885156035423279,0.0011603247839957476,0.023128796368837357,0.03664673492312431,-0.09018830209970474,0.06826304644346237,0.07808041572570801,-0.0027080997824668884,0.07891915738582611,-0.14114533364772797,0.06650357693433762,0.01629439741373062,-0.04185129702091217,-0.11883819103240967,-0.03600606322288513,0.006637151353061199,-0.022869901731610298,0.045186251401901245,-0.05819294974207878,-0.11493124067783356,-0.04341258108615875,0.04142541065812111,-0.09639668464660645,-0.05647168308496475,-0.018954267725348473,-0.03452111408114433,-3.469704471270238e-33,0.048700056970119476,-0.040152423083782196,0.03872748091816902,0.0021733397152274847,-0.030572332441806793,0.06582321226596832,0.07137419283390045,-0.03946864604949951,-0.008141015656292439,-0.020977171137928963,0.010313907638192177,0.020284432917833328,-0.054596029222011566,-0.01973598636686802,-0

{"title":"Illuminating cellular processes : developing new optic techniques to investigate cellular communication and translational control","abstract":"The human body comprises trillions of cells. Within single cells, complex cellular activities are precisely executed by millions of diverse proteins translated by the ubiquitous translational factory ribosome. How ribosomes control translation of each individual protein within subcellular space therefore dictates the cellular protein landscape at the nanometer resolution. Meanwhile, at the intercellular level, intricate cellular communication is required to coordinate individual cells to perform complex physiological activities. How trillions of cells achieve precise communication through the intertwined signaling network therefore dictates the physiological outcomes at the organismal level. However, direct visualization of these cellular processes has been technically challenging due to the lack of tools with the required spatial resolution. Here, I present novel optical innovations to spatially investigate cellular communication and translational control, respectively. In the first project, I develop an optogenetic toolbox to manipulate cellular communications using artificial myosin motors. Utilizing this toolbox, I am capable of directly probing the molecules transported within long cellular extensions and controlling the dynamics of both filopodia and neurites. I further demonstrate the presence and importance of specialized filopodia in the re-establishment of a Sonic Hedgehog signaling gradient during axolotl limb regeneration. In the second project, I investigate translation control within subcellular space with two orthogonal approaches. Specifically, I develop an optimized expansion microscopy technique to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique to characterize their composition. Utilizing both techniques, I unveil enrichment of the 60S large subunit on the endoplasmic reticulum that is critical for the selective translation of transmembrane proteins. I further discover ribosomal heterogeneity on the mitochondria that is linked to the translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Taken together, these advancements in optic techniques empower us to shed light on cellular processes at different scales with unprecedented resolution.","vector":[-0.013875371776521206,-0.13530153036117554,0.009553995914757252,-0.09123349189758301,-0.06001424789428711,-0.09515462070703506,0.04874672368168831,0.009611930698156357,0.08799564838409424,0.031398285180330276,-0.043410420417785645,-0.0028981242794543505,-0.06433329731225967,0.0812305137515068,-0.03203748166561127,0.07106690108776093,0.016740135848522186,0.06903339922428131,-0.023438023403286934,0.02418435923755169,0.12221407890319824,-0.015464995987713337,0.008422458544373512,-0.015409835614264011,-0.06181253120303154,-0.013746189884841442,0.019394537433981895,0.028026094660162926,-0.04667549207806587,-0.04270165041089058,0.007896979339420795,0.04755531996488571,-0.04465524107217789,0.024980125948786736,-0.04054401442408562,0.035816021263599396,0.017527785152196884,-0.026776988059282303,-0.007518739905208349,-0.05386504903435707,0.08572673797607422,0.012021513655781746,0.043535951524972916,-0.02424733154475689,0.08604609966278076,0.029548747465014458,0.008438426069915295,0.011077692732214928,-0.005632755812257528,0.017204992473125458,-0.0518328994512558,-0.0558663010597229,-0.009263950400054455,0.013603579252958298,0.08101232349872589,0.1456928849220276,-0.03792354837059975,-3.693047983688302e-05,0.05488182604312897,-0.042161110788583755,0.058455292135477066,-0.015095086768269539,-0.023591261357069016,-0.008385533466935158,0.011634244583547115,-0.004667286761105061,0.03685080260038376,0.06130636855959892,-0.027941524982452393,0.04764100909233093,-0.025874946266412735,0.0351828895509243,0.015298261307179928,0.07897541671991348,0.04202483594417572,0.02537696249783039,0.02433887869119644,0.0819234773516655,0.015163611620664597,-0.0446474589407444,0.09034497290849686,0.031441688537597656,0.09342669695615768,0.07321036607027054,0.01823529228568077,0.07256018370389938,0.028638774529099464,0.06370417773723602,-0.049497801810503006,-0.02443038858473301,-0.04526422917842865,-0.03927994519472122,-0.026689760386943817,-0.03668220713734627,-0.06379169225692749,-0.08244084566831589,-0.020688824355602264,-0.04844982549548149,0.002212166553363204,-0.016162382438778877,0.08155722171068192,-0.07739163190126419,0.04508085548877716,-0.03397228196263313,-0.0183258056640625,-0.028799613937735558,0.05683945491909981,0.05599760264158249,-0.0212521031498909,0.1031334176659584,-0.016204746440052986,-0.0006511295796371996,-0.03851772099733353,0.09852415323257446,0.02524758316576481,0.0879301130771637,-0.05048232153058052,0.02776782587170601,0.05026857182383537,0.03329866752028465,-0.03624200075864792,-0.017804933711886406,-0.044325195252895355,-0.0018061603186652064,-0.0390535369515419,0.07107514142990112,-0.024279123172163963,2.362460057140662e-33,0.03928865119814873,0.06832163780927658,0.0240569356828928,0.057385314255952835,0.02383682131767273,-0.01664355956017971,0.020860588178038597,-0.04186910763382912,-0.08397212624549866,-0.030357424169778824,-0.07190030813217163,0.059831179678440094,-0.014044677838683128,0.09948327392339706,0.011852930299937725,-0.10034114122390747,-0.07541966438293457,0.033120185136795044,0.012989645823836327,0.023744169622659683,0.0013473880244418979,-0.005380711983889341,-0.020767949521541595,-0.014943561516702175,-0.008353840559720993,-0.04803330823779106,-0.04455506056547165,-0.036029115319252014,0.06483719497919083,-0.011517172679305077,-0.13230744004249573,0.08260960131883621,0.04686255753040314,-0.03483530879020691,0.06476884335279465,-0.03138319402933121,0.04803912341594696,-0.07344739884138107,0.023517094552516937,0.003264790866523981,0.017830805853009224,0.014030144549906254,-0.03591000288724899,-0.06590356677770615,-0.014977245591580868,-0.0033876181114465,-0.02858698181807995,0.04781416803598404,-0.10405272990465164,-0.04395565390586853,0.01620381325483322,-0.017182696610689163,0.08999980241060257,-0.0747540220618248,0.024893900379538536,-0.026198172941803932,-0.09265081584453583,-0.026485422626137733,0.026207515969872475,0.00485971150919795,0.020855002105236053,-0.09957271069288254,0.014560075476765633,0.0706406906247139,0.05183486267924309,0.07718594372272491,-0.08604252338409424,0.002900288440287113,0.012254692614078522,0.06885156035423279,0.0011603247839957476,0.023128796368837357,0.03664673492312431,-0.09018830209970474,0.06826304644346237,0.07808041572570801,-0.0027080997824668884,0.07891915738582611,-0.14114533364772797,0.06650357693433762,0.01629439741373062,-0.04185129702091217,-0.11883819103240967,-0.03600606322288513,0.006637151353061199,-0.022869901731610298,0.045186251401901245,-0.05819294974207878,-0.11493124067783356,-0.04341258108615875,0.04142541065812111,-0.09639668464660645,-0.05647168308496475,-0.018954267725348473,-0.03452111408114433,-3.469704471270238e-33,0.048700056970119476,-0.040152423083782196,0.03872748091816902,0.0021733397152274847,-0.030572332441806793,0.06582321226596832,0.07137419283390045,-0.03946864604949951,-0.008141015656292439,-0.020977171137928963,0.010313907638192177,0.020284432917833328,-0.054596029222011566,-0.01973598636686802,-0

Within single cells, complex cellular activities are precisely executed by millions of diverse proteins translated by the ubiquitous translational factory ribosome. How ribosomes control translation of each individual protein within subcellular space therefore dictates the cellular protein landscape at the nanometer resolution. Meanwhile, at the intercellular level, intricate cellular communication is required to coordinate individual cells to perform complex physiological activities. How trillions of cells achieve precise communication through the intertwined signaling network therefore dictates the physiological outcomes at the organismal level. However, direct visualization of these cellular processes has been technically challenging due to the lack of tools with the required spatial resolution. Here, I present novel optical innovations to spatially investigate cellular communication and translational control, respectively. In the first project, I develop an optogenetic toolbox to manipulate cellular communications using artificial myosin motors. Utilizing this toolbox, I am capable of directly probing the molecules transported within long cellular extensions and controlling the dynamics of both filopodia and neurites. I further demonstrate the presence and importance of specialized filopodia in the re-establishment of a Sonic Hedgehog signaling gradient during axolotl limb regeneration. In the second project, I investigate translation control within subcellular space with two orthogonal approaches. Specifically, I develop an optimized expansion microscopy technique to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique to characterize their composition. Utilizing both techniques, I unveil enrichment of the 60S large subunit on the endoplasmic reticulum that is critical for the selective translation of transmembrane proteins. I further discover ribosomal heterogeneity on the mitochondria that is linked to the translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Taken together, these advancements in optic techniques empower us to shed light on cellular processes at different scales with unprecedented

{"title":"Illuminating cellular processes : developing new optic techniques to investigate cellular communication and translational control","abstract":"The human body comprises trillions of cells. Within single cells, complex cellular activities are precisely executed by millions of diverse proteins translated by the ubiquitous translational factory ribosome. How ribosomes control translation of each individual protein within subcellular space therefore dictates the cellular protein landscape at the nanometer resolution. Meanwhile, at the intercellular level, intricate cellular communication is required to coordinate individual cells to perform complex physiological activities. How trillions of cells achieve precise communication through the intertwined signaling network therefore dictates the physiological outcomes at the organismal level. However, direct visualization of these cellular processes has been technically challenging due to the lack of tools with the required spatial resolution. Here, I present novel optical innovations to spatially investigate cellular communication and translational control, respectively. In the first project, I develop an optogenetic toolbox to manipulate cellular communications using artificial myosin motors. Utilizing this toolbox, I am capable of directly probing the molecules transported within long cellular extensions and controlling the dynamics of both filopodia and neurites. I further demonstrate the presence and importance of specialized filopodia in the re-establishment of a Sonic Hedgehog signaling gradient during axolotl limb regeneration. In the second project, I investigate translation control within subcellular space with two orthogonal approaches. Specifically, I develop an optimized expansion microscopy technique to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique to characterize their composition. Utilizing both techniques, I unveil enrichment of the 60S large subunit on the endoplasmic reticulum that is critical for the selective translation of transmembrane proteins. I further discover ribosomal heterogeneity on the mitochondria that is linked to the translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Taken together, these advancements in optic techniques empower us to shed light on cellular processes at different scales with unprecedented resolution.","vector":[-0.013875371776521206,-0.13530153036117554,0.009553995914757252,-0.09123349189758301,-0.06001424789428711,-0.09515462070703506,0.04874672368168831,0.009611930698156357,0.08799564838409424,0.031398285180330276,-0.043410420417785645,-0.0028981242794543505,-0.06433329731225967,0.0812305137515068,-0.03203748166561127,0.07106690108776093,0.016740135848522186,0.06903339922428131,-0.023438023403286934,0.02418435923755169,0.12221407890319824,-0.015464995987713337,0.008422458544373512,-0.015409835614264011,-0.06181253120303154,-0.013746189884841442,0.019394537433981895,0.028026094660162926,-0.04667549207806587,-0.04270165041089058,0.007896979339420795,0.04755531996488571,-0.04465524107217789,0.024980125948786736,-0.04054401442408562,0.035816021263599396,0.017527785152196884,-0.026776988059282303,-0.007518739905208349,-0.05386504903435707,0.08572673797607422,0.012021513655781746,0.043535951524972916,-0.02424733154475689,0.08604609966278076,0.029548747465014458,0.008438426069915295,0.011077692732214928,-0.005632755812257528,0.017204992473125458,-0.0518328994512558,-0.0558663010597229,-0.009263950400054455,0.013603579252958298,0.08101232349872589,0.1456928849220276,-0.03792354837059975,-3.693047983688302e-05,0.05488182604312897,-0.042161110788583755,0.058455292135477066,-0.015095086768269539,-0.023591261357069016,-0.008385533466935158,0.011634244583547115,-0.004667286761105061,0.03685080260038376,0.06130636855959892,-0.027941524982452393,0.04764100909233093,-0.025874946266412735,0.0351828895509243,0.015298261307179928,0.07897541671991348,0.04202483594417572,0.02537696249783039,0.02433887869119644,0.0819234773516655,0.015163611620664597,-0.0446474589407444,0.09034497290849686,0.031441688537597656,0.09342669695615768,0.07321036607027054,0.01823529228568077,0.07256018370389938,0.028638774529099464,0.06370417773723602,-0.049497801810503006,-0.02443038858473301,-0.04526422917842865,-0.03927994519472122,-0.026689760386943817,-0.03668220713734627,-0.06379169225692749,-0.08244084566831589,-0.020688824355602264,-0.04844982549548149,0.002212166553363204,-0.016162382438778877,0.08155722171068192,-0.07739163190126419,0.04508085548877716,-0.03397228196263313,-0.0183258056640625,-0.028799613937735558,0.05683945491909981,0.05599760264158249,-0.0212521031498909,0.1031334176659584,-0.016204746440052986,-0.0006511295796371996,-0.03851772099733353,0.09852415323257446,0.02524758316576481,0.0879301130771637,-0.05048232153058052,0.02776782587170601,0.05026857182383537,0.03329866752028465,-0.03624200075864792,-0.017804933711886406,-0.044325195252895355,-0.0018061603186652064,-0.0390535369515419,0.07107514142990112,-0.024279123172163963,2.362460057140662e-33,0.03928865119814873,0.06832163780927658,0.0240569356828928,0.057385314255952835,0.02383682131767273,-0.01664355956017971,0.020860588178038597,-0.04186910763382912,-0.08397212624549866,-0.030357424169778824,-0.07190030813217163,0.059831179678440094,-0.014044677838683128,0.09948327392339706,0.011852930299937725,-0.10034114122390747,-0.07541966438293457,0.033120185136795044,0.012989645823836327,0.023744169622659683,0.0013473880244418979,-0.005380711983889341,-0.020767949521541595,-0.014943561516702175,-0.008353840559720993,-0.04803330823779106,-0.04455506056547165,-0.036029115319252014,0.06483719497919083,-0.011517172679305077,-0.13230744004249573,0.08260960131883621,0.04686255753040314,-0.03483530879020691,0.06476884335279465,-0.03138319402933121,0.04803912341594696,-0.07344739884138107,0.023517094552516937,0.003264790866523981,0.017830805853009224,0.014030144549906254,-0.03591000288724899,-0.06590356677770615,-0.014977245591580868,-0.0033876181114465,-0.02858698181807995,0.04781416803598404,-0.10405272990465164,-0.04395565390586853,0.01620381325483322,-0.017182696610689163,0.08999980241060257,-0.0747540220618248,0.024893900379538536,-0.026198172941803932,-0.09265081584453583,-0.026485422626137733,0.026207515969872475,0.00485971150919795,0.020855002105236053,-0.09957271069288254,0.014560075476765633,0.0706406906247139,0.05183486267924309,0.07718594372272491,-0.08604252338409424,0.002900288440287113,0.012254692614078522,0.06885156035423279,0.0011603247839957476,0.023128796368837357,0.03664673492312431,-0.09018830209970474,0.06826304644346237,0.07808041572570801,-0.0027080997824668884,0.07891915738582611,-0.14114533364772797,0.06650357693433762,0.01629439741373062,-0.04185129702091217,-0.11883819103240967,-0.03600606322288513,0.006637151353061199,-0.022869901731610298,0.045186251401901245,-0.05819294974207878,-0.11493124067783356,-0.04341258108615875,0.04142541065812111,-0.09639668464660645,-0.05647168308496475,-0.018954267725348473,-0.03452111408114433,-3.469704471270238e-33,0.048700056970119476,-0.040152423083782196,0.03872748091816902,0.0021733397152274847,-0.030572332441806793,0.06582321226596832,0.07137419283390045,-0.03946864604949951,-0.008141015656292439,-0.020977171137928963,0.010313907638192177,0.020284432917833328,-0.054596029222011566,-0.01973598636686802,-0

{"title":"Illuminating cellular processes : developing new optic techniques to investigate cellular communication and translational control","abstract":"The human body comprises trillions of cells. Within single cells, complex cellular activities are precisely executed by millions of diverse proteins translated by the ubiquitous translational factory ribosome. How ribosomes control translation of each individual protein within subcellular space therefore dictates the cellular protein landscape at the nanometer resolution. Meanwhile, at the intercellular level, intricate cellular communication is required to coordinate individual cells to perform complex physiological activities. How trillions of cells achieve precise communication through the intertwined signaling network therefore dictates the physiological outcomes at the organismal level. However, direct visualization of these cellular processes has been technically challenging due to the lack of tools with the required spatial resolution. Here, I present novel optical innovations to spatially investigate cellular communication and translational control, respectively. In the first project, I develop an optogenetic toolbox to manipulate cellular communications using artificial myosin motors. Utilizing this toolbox, I am capable of directly probing the molecules transported within long cellular extensions and controlling the dynamics of both filopodia and neurites. I further demonstrate the presence and importance of specialized filopodia in the re-establishment of a Sonic Hedgehog signaling gradient during axolotl limb regeneration. In the second project, I investigate translation control within subcellular space with two orthogonal approaches. Specifically, I develop an optimized expansion microscopy technique to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique to characterize their composition. Utilizing both techniques, I unveil enrichment of the 60S large subunit on the endoplasmic reticulum that is critical for the selective translation of transmembrane proteins. I further discover ribosomal heterogeneity on the mitochondria that is linked to the translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Taken together, these advancements in optic techniques empower us to shed light on cellular processes at different scales with unprecedented resolution.","vector":[-0.013875371776521206,-0.13530153036117554,0.009553995914757252,-0.09123349189758301,-0.06001424789428711,-0.09515462070703506,0.04874672368168831,0.009611930698156357,0.08799564838409424,0.031398285180330276,-0.043410420417785645,-0.0028981242794543505,-0.06433329731225967,0.0812305137515068,-0.03203748166561127,0.07106690108776093,0.016740135848522186,0.06903339922428131,-0.023438023403286934,0.02418435923755169,0.12221407890319824,-0.015464995987713337,0.008422458544373512,-0.015409835614264011,-0.06181253120303154,-0.013746189884841442,0.019394537433981895,0.028026094660162926,-0.04667549207806587,-0.04270165041089058,0.007896979339420795,0.04755531996488571,-0.04465524107217789,0.024980125948786736,-0.04054401442408562,0.035816021263599396,0.017527785152196884,-0.026776988059282303,-0.007518739905208349,-0.05386504903435707,0.08572673797607422,0.012021513655781746,0.043535951524972916,-0.02424733154475689,0.08604609966278076,0.029548747465014458,0.008438426069915295,0.011077692732214928,-0.005632755812257528,0.017204992473125458,-0.0518328994512558,-0.0558663010597229,-0.009263950400054455,0.013603579252958298,0.08101232349872589,0.1456928849220276,-0.03792354837059975,-3.693047983688302e-05,0.05488182604312897,-0.042161110788583755,0.058455292135477066,-0.015095086768269539,-0.023591261357069016,-0.008385533466935158,0.011634244583547115,-0.004667286761105061,0.03685080260038376,0.06130636855959892,-0.027941524982452393,0.04764100909233093,-0.025874946266412735,0.0351828895509243,0.015298261307179928,0.07897541671991348,0.04202483594417572,0.02537696249783039,0.02433887869119644,0.0819234773516655,0.015163611620664597,-0.0446474589407444,0.09034497290849686,0.031441688537597656,0.09342669695615768,0.07321036607027054,0.01823529228568077,0.07256018370389938,0.028638774529099464,0.06370417773723602,-0.049497801810503006,-0.02443038858473301,-0.04526422917842865,-0.03927994519472122,-0.026689760386943817,-0.03668220713734627,-0.06379169225692749,-0.08244084566831589,-0.020688824355602264,-0.04844982549548149,0.002212166553363204,-0.016162382438778877,0.08155722171068192,-0.07739163190126419,0.04508085548877716,-0.03397228196263313,-0.0183258056640625,-0.028799613937735558,0.05683945491909981,0.05599760264158249,-0.0212521031498909,0.1031334176659584,-0.016204746440052986,-0.0006511295796371996,-0.03851772099733353,0.09852415323257446,0.02524758316576481,0.0879301130771637,-0.05048232153058052,0.02776782587170601,0.05026857182383537,0.03329866752028465,-0.03624200075864792,-0.017804933711886406,-0.044325195252895355,-0.0018061603186652064,-0.0390535369515419,0.07107514142990112,-0.024279123172163963,2.362460057140662e-33,0.03928865119814873,0.06832163780927658,0.0240569356828928,0.057385314255952835,0.02383682131767273,-0.01664355956017971,0.020860588178038597,-0.04186910763382912,-0.08397212624549866,-0.030357424169778824,-0.07190030813217163,0.059831179678440094,-0.014044677838683128,0.09948327392339706,0.011852930299937725,-0.10034114122390747,-0.07541966438293457,0.033120185136795044,0.012989645823836327,0.023744169622659683,0.0013473880244418979,-0.005380711983889341,-0.020767949521541595,-0.014943561516702175,-0.008353840559720993,-0.04803330823779106,-0.04455506056547165,-0.036029115319252014,0.06483719497919083,-0.011517172679305077,-0.13230744004249573,0.08260960131883621,0.04686255753040314,-0.03483530879020691,0.06476884335279465,-0.03138319402933121,0.04803912341594696,-0.07344739884138107,0.023517094552516937,0.003264790866523981,0.017830805853009224,0.014030144549906254,-0.03591000288724899,-0.06590356677770615,-0.014977245591580868,-0.0033876181114465,-0.02858698181807995,0.04781416803598404,-0.10405272990465164,-0.04395565390586853,0.01620381325483322,-0.017182696610689163,0.08999980241060257,-0.0747540220618248,0.024893900379538536,-0.026198172941803932,-0.09265081584453583,-0.026485422626137733,0.026207515969872475,0.00485971150919795,0.020855002105236053,-0.09957271069288254,0.014560075476765633,0.0706406906247139,0.05183486267924309,0.07718594372272491,-0.08604252338409424,0.002900288440287113,0.012254692614078522,0.06885156035423279,0.0011603247839957476,0.023128796368837357,0.03664673492312431,-0.09018830209970474,0.06826304644346237,0.07808041572570801,-0.0027080997824668884,0.07891915738582611,-0.14114533364772797,0.06650357693433762,0.01629439741373062,-0.04185129702091217,-0.11883819103240967,-0.03600606322288513,0.006637151353061199,-0.022869901731610298,0.045186251401901245,-0.05819294974207878,-0.11493124067783356,-0.04341258108615875,0.04142541065812111,-0.09639668464660645,-0.05647168308496475,-0.018954267725348473,-0.03452111408114433,-3.469704471270238e-33,0.048700056970119476,-0.040152423083782196,0.03872748091816902,0.0021733397152274847,-0.030572332441806793,0.06582321226596832,0.07137419283390045,-0.03946864604949951,-0.008141015656292439,-0.020977171137928963,0.010313907638192177,0.020284432917833328,-0.054596029222011566,-0.01973598636686802,-0

Within single cells, complex cellular activities are precisely executed by millions of diverse proteins translated by the ubiquitous translational factory ribosome. How ribosomes control translation of each individual protein within subcellular space therefore dictates the cellular protein landscape at the nanometer resolution. Meanwhile, at the intercellular level, intricate cellular communication is required to coordinate individual cells to perform complex physiological activities. How trillions of cells achieve precise communication through the intertwined signaling network therefore dictates the physiological outcomes at the organismal level. However, direct visualization of these cellular processes has been technically challenging due to the lack of tools with the required spatial resolution. Here, I present novel optical innovations to spatially investigate cellular communication and translational control, respectively. In the first project, I develop an optogenetic toolbox to manipulate cellular communications using artificial myosin motors. Utilizing this toolbox, I am capable of directly probing the molecules transported within long cellular extensions and controlling the dynamics of both filopodia and neurites. I further demonstrate the presence and importance of specialized filopodia in the re-establishment of a Sonic Hedgehog signaling gradient during axolotl limb regeneration. In the second project, I investigate translation control within subcellular space with two orthogonal approaches. Specifically, I develop an optimized expansion microscopy technique to visualize individual ribosomes and an optogenetic proximity-labeling technique to characterize their composition. Utilizing both techniques, I unveil enrichment of the 60S large subunit on the endoplasmic reticulum that is critical for the selective translation of transmembrane proteins. I further discover ribosomal heterogeneity on the mitochondria that is linked to the translation of metabolism-related transcripts. Taken together, these advancements in optic techniques empower us to shed light on cellular processes at different scales with unprecedented

{"title":"Giving robots a light touch : unobtrusive tactile perception in unstructured spaces","abstract":"Advancements in robotics are leading toward their integration into domestic settings for the automation of household chores. However, the inherent complexity of unstructured environments, such as homes, poses a formidable challenge for robots. Unlike controlled industrial settings, homes exhibit diverse layouts, variable lighting conditions, and occlusions that render conventional vision-only perception systems inadequate. Mundane yet crucial tasks, like retrieving an item from the rear of a refrigerator, underscore the limitations of solely relying on visual cues. This thesis introduces tactile sensing strategies to enhance robots' performance in unstructured environments. Specifically I demonstrate three approaches that aim to provide robots with new tactile capabilities: (i) a soft distributed tactile skin for safe navigation in spaces with obstacles, (ii)  whisker-inspired sensors for non-intrusive object perception, and (iii) low-inertia grippers for low-impact interactions.  First, I investigate how to ensure gentle interaction with objects by introducing a soft tactile skin with distributed sensors. This tactile skin helps robots to safely navigate tight spaces by reducing contact forces. By giving robots the ability to detect light contacts and move so as to keep those contact forces small, the skin can mitigate the effects of frequent unplanned contacts (e.g. tipping objects) in cluttered environments.  Second, I investigate how robots can leverage contacts to sense their environment. I introduce whisker-inspired sensors that allow robots to sense objects through continuous gentle contact. Non-intrusive contact with objects enables robots to perceive distant objects and partially determine their shapes. With repeated exploration of the environment, the tracked contacts allow the robot to build an understanding of the environment that is robust to visual occlusions.  Last, I investigate how low-impact contacts can be leveraged to enable robots to explore and manipulate objects in the environment. I introduce a low-inertia gripper design that enables robots to confidently locate objects by contacting them, determine some of their properties (e.g., weight), and grasp them.  In summary, this thesis explores ways to use soft and light tactile sensors and end-effectors to increase the ability of robots to perceive and operate in the cluttered and contact-rich environments.","vector":[0.0028804608155041933,-0.03719127178192139,0.02856612578034401,0.042624685913324356,0.10782923549413681,-0.04668967425823212,0.05940078943967819,0.0013237950624898076,-0.014314631000161171,0.023867934942245483,0.025163954123854637,-0.0959223210811615,0.0058852252550423145,0.05726611614227295,0.05000465363264084,0.009591887705028057,0.12339285016059875,0.0947769284248352,-0.02905704826116562,0.05815194547176361,0.05469422787427902,0.006324334070086479,0.12329716980457306,-0.04944351688027382,-0.08111010491847992,-0.016138991340994835,0.006509344093501568,-0.08454559743404388,-0.0507940873503685,-0.04150703176856041,-0.014702195301651955,-0.08936364203691483,-0.10151995718479156,-0.0022201347164809704,-0.00419134134426713,0.0191192589700222,0.05382552742958069,0.057949576526880264,0.04114299640059471,-0.04445069655776024,-0.0034876561257988214,-0.008770544081926346,0.03168205916881561,-0.018073998391628265,0.03330383822321892,0.07718762010335922,0.06772089004516602,0.027376092970371246,0.03956136107444763,-0.005735590122640133,-0.05348796397447586,-0.00832479540258646,0.10316727310419083,-0.023265700787305832,-0.032788123935461044,0.031167801469564438,-0.04961082711815834,-0.049582287669181824,0.0504254475235939,-0.01913262903690338,0.08829885721206665,-0.0930120199918747,0.12371817976236343,-0.04754889756441116,-0.05852508917450905,0.012297514826059341,0.0057675838470458984,0.008334427140653133,0.009285636246204376,-0.021893970668315887,0.00024364111595787108,0.026230141520500183,0.04754767194390297,0.014256751164793968,0.0240712258964777,-0.09115439653396606,-0.05461039021611214,0.015953294932842255,-0.04751108959317207,0.023480266332626343,0.019250454381108284,-0.04083159193396568,-0.03720509260892868,0.031205056235194206,-0.06682062149047852,0.002687891712412238,0.03441336378455162,0.02414785325527191,-0.022041713818907738,0.03585287928581238,0.03377856686711311,-0.056648969650268555,-0.09456708282232285,-0.03407355025410652,0.0032343873754143715,-0.15114599466323853,0.030099226161837578,-0.02176535129547119,-0.07155273854732513,0.0010500625940039754,-0.05067647248506546,-0.043383460491895676,-0.026734821498394012,0.009290984831750393,0.014495091512799263,-0.060683876276016235,-0.04398910328745842,-0.06079254299402237,0.010314030572772026,0.04308953136205673,0.03466634452342987,-0.08283970504999161,-0.04409860074520111,0.08203552663326263,-0.03566210716962814,-0.1273384541273117,-0.021858664229512215,-0.02538071759045124,0.08818946033716202,0.008933717384934425,0.06027710437774658,-0.034414224326610565,0.00827909354120493,-0.01156586967408657,0.15583209693431854,0.03325233981013298,0.03867383673787117,2.6461437618635355e-33,0.0013431208208203316,0.07437588274478912,-0.008708994835615158,-0.045914359390735626,0.027108507230877876,-0.0586354024708271,0.02603386901319027,0.0575995147228241,-0.055768758058547974,0.043034713715314865,-0.0011250717798247933,0.006240152288228273,-0.04118549823760986,0.06622123718261719,0.06336130946874619,-0.0503385029733181,0.0526450090110302,-0.014683547429740429,0.011845574714243412,0.0129694240167737,-0.03664858266711235,0.030556077137589455,-0.007816724479198456,0.0569068007171154,-0.04986592382192612,0.03839755803346634,0.043443985283374786,0.0035132807679474354,0.06839074194431305,0.013471118174493313,-0.008684803731739521,-0.002081779995933175,0.03370518609881401,0.0558629035949707,-0.02626846544444561,0.12159174680709839,-0.07663290202617645,-0.043481264263391495,0.0394405871629715,-0.09864356368780136,-0.04227827861905098,0.071669802069664,0.04751177877187729,-0.03620101511478424,-0.024817422032356262,0.008975682780146599,-0.0027261513751000166,0.03208676725625992,-0.08829424530267715,-0.0338597297668457,0.012928111478686333,-0.019858570769429207,0.029908856377005577,-0.02929532900452614,-0.054712943732738495,-0.10639763623476028,-0.02849474921822548,-0.008446354418992996,-0.011986514553427696,-0.026776200160384178,-0.010742343962192535,-0.033150140196084976,0.03420994058251381,-0.0019080759957432747,0.02811037190258503,-0.02944132313132286,0.017123261466622353,0.09688058495521545,0.02684527263045311,0.016972186043858528,-0.026526030153036118,0.02288217656314373,0.07198922336101532,-0.020874977111816406,0.03667828440666199,0.06290218979120255,0.02506186254322529,-0.1080293282866478,0.03434010595083237,-0.03500857949256897,-0.0008630541269667447,0.05736025422811508,0.04674923047423363,-0.007230657618492842,-0.007681748364120722,-0.018298599869012833,-0.018665196374058723,0.04058115556836128,-0.049989063292741776,0.045345570892095566,-0.07031933218240738,-0.034554578363895416,-0.030081111937761307,0.04422673210501671,-0.08534596115350723,-2.140209891243669e-33,0.07580730319023132,-0.03774312883615494,0.013839464634656906,0.0799812451004982,-0.03523692488670349,-0.012813068926334381,-0.03907238692045212,-0.026030225679278374,-0.014918804168701172,-0.025505922734737396,-0.04474597051739693,-0.02539922297000885,0.041180696338415146,0.086019769310951

{"title":"Tracing T cell clonal responses to chronic antigen stimulation using single-cell T cell receptor sequencing approaches","abstract":"T cells play a central role in the immune response, protecting the host against immune challenges while maintaining self-tolerance. During acute infection, naïve T cells are activated in response to antigen and differentiate into memory precursors and effector T cells. Upon antigen clearance, effector T cells undergo apoptosis while memory cells survive and persist as long-lived memory T cells that are ready in case of subsequent infection. In settings where antigen stimulation persists, as in chronic infections and cancer, T cell development is modulated, such as through the development of exhausted T cell states characterized by limited effector function and high sustained expression of inhibitory receptors. How T cell responses to chronic antigen stimulation develop and are maintained are not well understood, especially at the level of individual T cell clones. Recently, the development of single-cell genomics technologies has enabled high-resolution profiling of the T cell compartment at the clonal and phenotypic levels. In particular, the ability to sequence the T cell receptor (TCR) of individual cells in parallel with gene expression allows for the dissection of the TCR repertoire in the context of cell states and finer interrogation of T cell clonal dynamics. Here, we dissect various aspects of the T cell response to chronic antigen stimulation by tracing clones using TCR sequencing methods. First, we demonstrate that CD4 T cell responses are maintained during chronic viral infection by a memory-like progenitor population. Then, we profile the T cell response to immune checkpoint blockade and characterize the regional distribution and cell states of T cell clones within the tumor, lymph nodes, and peripheral circulation of patients with lung cancer. Altogether, this work demonstrates how clonal tracing through single-cell TCR sequencing technologies and computational approaches can be leveraged to uncover features of T cell responses to chronic

{"title":"Advancing ambient intelligence in healthcare : granularity, efficiency, and privacy","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by providing cutting-edge solutions that can significantly enhance patient care and medical research. However, this wave of technological transformation has largely overlooked the physical environment of clinical care delivery. This dissertation illuminates the significant impact of integrating video activity recognition, powered by advanced machine learning and intelligent sensors, into ICU and residential care, demonstrating its potential to alleviate healthcare burdens and improve patient outcomes. We first detail how healthcare spaces can be equipped with ambient intelligence using smart sensors and machine learning algorithms. We then introduce three crucial technical foundations that enable this application. Firstly, we instantiate a novel task, benchmark, and model for discerning complex human activities, offering a hierarchical comprehension of actor roles, object attributes, and their relationships. Secondly, we unveil a suite of data and label-efficient algorithms tailored to address overcome the scarcity of annotated data, a challenge amplified by privacy constraints, proprietary considerations, and the substantial costs associated with domain-specific annotation. Finally, we embark on a comprehensive dialogue on ensuring trustworthy machine learning from ethical and privacy perspectives.  We introduce a scalable, differentially private algorithm, specifically designed for large-scale video activity recognition tasks.

{"title":"A  study of two-dimensional superconductors with scanning-SQUID microscopy","abstract":"Superconductors, with characteristic zero-resistance, Messier screening, and phase coherence at low temperatures, find applications in power transmission, high-speed transportation, and quantum computing. The warmest ambient pressure superconductor to date has a transition temperature of 100 Celsius below room temperature. Finding room-temperature superconductors is the holy grail. In order to achieve that, it is necessary to understand the superconducting mechanism through careful characterization of existing superconductors.       In recent years, we have witnessed the discovery of several new superconducting systems. The infinite-layer nickelate, a structural analogy of the famous cuprates, was achieved through topotactic reduction. The twisted few-layer graphene systems displayed complex phase diagrams similar to the cuprates. The monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide showed evidence of topological superconductivity. In addition, straining well-established high-temperature superconductors such as cuprates was found to enhance the critical temperature. The ever-so-vibrant research on superconductivity opens new possibilities for deciphering the mechanism of these strongly correlated electron systems.      This thesis presents scanning SQUID microscopy (SSM) imaging of the above-mentioned superconductors. The SSM visualizes mesoscopic magnetic structures that cannot be seen in transport measurements. Our results break assumptions that might be used to extrapolate useful physical quantities in bulk measurements. Applying a local field, the SSM directly probes the local superfluid density, revealing spatial inhomogeneity and its interplay with intrinsic magnetic structures, namely vortices.","vector":[-0.1344621479511261,0.008702637627720833,-0.018979767337441444,0.031005755066871643,0.06757164001464844,0.01890707015991211,-2.0113382561248727e-05,-0.01701248623430729,-0.0771212950348854,0.02565450221300125,0.06008884310722351,-0.08701959997415543,0.008803552016615868,0.017901474609971046,0.04614129662513733,-0.08223951607942581,0.06421501934528351,-0.07380719482898712,0.073020800948143,0.008055144920945168,0.040544383227825165,-0.054450009018182755,-0.007581470534205437,-0.04410085827112198,0.054426465183496475,0.10759426653385162,-0.04129362851381302,-0.049373917281627655,0.003496611025184393,0.011436513625085354,0.06260140240192413,-0.004352363757789135,-0.125036358833313,0.07309489697217941,-0.0030972142703831196,0.06237729638814926,0.08470869064331055,-0.007515841629356146,0.034629397094249725,-0.047809671610593796,0.005814237054437399,0.04220378398895264,0.015674492344260216,0.01599493809044361,0.03351770341396332,0.03396026790142059,0.043621648102998734,0.04929053410887718,0.025468897074460983,-0.08657652884721756,-0.022483758628368378,-0.019683700054883957,0.0470687635242939,0.004678247030824423,0.10169506818056107,0.12324488908052444,0.018254946917295456,-0.026654532179236412,-0.01781930960714817,0.03295710310339928,0.01982254534959793,0.001365847303532064,0.016511335968971252,-0.004515733104199171,0.05776217579841614,0.009463868103921413,0.009477178566157818,0.05727791786193848,0.047416895627975464,0.02307279407978058,-0.010265362448990345,0.02010069042444229,0.017877181991934776,-0.029643140733242035,0.09313617646694183,0.004471607971936464,0.005376219749450684,0.008422942832112312,0.08372370898723602,-0.04080379381775856,-0.07064275443553925,-0.031243357807397842,0.08117871731519699,0.055166095495224,-0.07581090182065964,0.010346398688852787,0.06272993981838226,-0.0971556305885315,-0.12159347534179688,-0.09454696625471115,0.009393434040248394,0.0008137754630297422,-0.09072112292051315,-0.010469143278896809,0.010085714980959892,0.04262152686715126,0.0280920397490263,0.10459934920072556,0.003779518650844693,-0.04087897390127182,0.14594398438930511,-0.09167897701263428,0.005107067991048098,-0.04068252816796303,0.02668338641524315,-0.005107032135128975,0.02433393895626068,0.07488834857940674,0.009331343695521355,0.0010617108782753348,-0.02634119987487793,0.07885827124118805,0.06485535949468613,-0.04362393170595169,-0.02283691242337227,-0.031085597351193428,-0.05514322966337204,0.01602979376912117,-0.01566353626549244,-0.006528094410896301,-0.03195977210998535,0.12204219400882721,-0.03118952363729477,0.011601677164435387,-0.04482022300362587,0.05912315100431442,-0.06181592866778374,3.749638165342996e-33,0.08603449165821075,0.04209161549806595,0.05029953271150589,-0.018580544739961624,0.02247137390077114,-0.045225974172353745,-0.05115201324224472,0.011179834604263306,-0.019573116675019264,0.04957397282123566,-0.00928699690848589,-0.0234077051281929,0.010819466784596443,0.03793591260910034,-0.00801091268658638,-0.0377584733068943,-0.06485120207071304,-0.07176293432712555,0.0730302482843399,-0.008263085968792439,0.005630045663565397,-0.002389004919677973,0.03200690448284149,0.060980454087257385,0.04227601736783981,-0.0447559654712677,0.01382251176983118,-0.010973278433084488,-0.004317230079323053,-0.0018066844204440713,-0.013418817892670631,0.011880742385983467,-0.01280516479164362,0.02997731603682041,-0.03493713587522507,-0.051466960459947586,0.047704409807920456,0.0005125333555042744,-0.0009434501989744604,-0.07217460125684738,-0.006363990716636181,-0.02410855144262314,-0.0045249611139297485,0.0029006858821958303,-0.04816916584968567,-0.019780533388257027,0.06468365341424942,0.012383481487631798,-0.02445392496883869,-0.0903463363647461,0.01493124570697546,-0.05905213952064514,-0.012030498124659061,0.06526503711938858,0.01286619808524847,0.03018065355718136,0.11843004822731018,-0.0012962487526237965,0.03776032477617264,-0.025422202423214912,0.022849824279546738,0.009462390094995499,-0.012053840793669224,0.038152169436216354,-0.06993546336889267,0.05669841542840004,-0.057453736662864685,0.03200623765587807,-0.007149021606892347,-0.04450695589184761,-0.046310026198625565,0.09399691224098206,0.09462959319353104,-0.039083994925022125,0.09521115571260452,0.02517271600663662,-0.05077225714921951,-0.09715655446052551,0.036890700459480286,-0.03658318892121315,0.020741138607263565,-0.00891860667616129,0.049728963524103165,-0.023035705089569092,-0.04155290126800537,-0.07283508777618408,0.013896695338189602,-0.009854989126324654,0.03536160662770271,0.016767635941505432,0.011156751774251461,-0.07784318178892136,0.05443589389324188,-0.05686560273170471,-0.06448497623205185,-3.553995497747858e-33,0.0405692532658577,-0.0006330644246190786,0.04377468302845955,-0.04039262980222702,0.01656508259475231,-0.021553201600909233,0.04076327383518219,-0.011919011361896992,0.04471924528479576,0.013804754242300987,0.12184257060289383,-0.022282272577285767,0.09925296157598495,-0.08578704297542572,0.019481245

{"title":"Understanding the regulation of residency and exhaustion in CD8-positive T cells","abstract":"CD8+ T cells are responsible for cell-based adaptive immunity and are required for protection against many pathogenic infections and malignant cellular transformation. To carry out their duty during the immune response, naïve CD8+ T cells (TN) can differentiate into many unique T cell states that have wide phenotypic variation and functional specialties. TN integrate both cell-intrinsic and external signals to determine their differentiation trajectory, which leads to the remodeling of the TN epigenome. In the context of acute antigenic stimulation, antigen-specific TN generate progeny of diverse potential, including short-lived, effector T cells (TEFF) and memory T cell precursors (TMP), which generate long-lived memory CD8+ T cells (TMEM). While each TEFF, TMP, and TMEM have distinct canonical roles in the immune response, there is phenotypic heterogeneity within each classification as well. Conversely, in the context of chronic antigen stimulation CD8+ T cells enter a hypofunctional state known as T cell exhaustion. Exhaustion is characterized by high co-inhibitory receptor expression, reduced cytokine expression, a distinct chromatin state, and reduced target cell killing. In this work, we sought to understand the transcriptional regulation and epigenetic state that underlies these complex and diverse CD8+ T cell states. We examined the single-cell chromatin landscape of CD8+ T cells over the course of in vivo acute viral infection and associated transcriptional changes to understand heterogeneity. We reveal an early bifurcation of memory precursors displaying distinct chromatin accessibility and define epigenetic trajectories that lead to a circulating (TCIRC) or tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cell fate. Further analysis of chromatin accessibility differences between TCIRC and TRM cell populations identified trans-regulatory elements (including ARID3A and ZFP384) as major regulators of memory T cell development in the liver. Moreover, despite being epigenetically heterogeneous within organs, TRM cells displayed a conserved epigenetic signature across tissues. We demonstrate that these cells exhibit tissue-specific signatures and identify transcription factors that regulate TRM cell populations in a site-specific manner. Last, we demonstrate that TRM cells and exhausted T (TEX) cells are distinct epigenetic lineages that are distinguishable early in their differentiation. Together, these findings show that TRM cell development is accompanied by dynamic alterations in chromatin accessibility that direct a unique transcriptional program resulting in a tissue-adapted and functionally distinct T cell state. We further sought to model and interrogate the regulation of primary human CD8+ T cell exhaustion. Here, we developed a model of chronic stimulation using sustained anti-CD3 antibody stimulation over the course of 10-14 days. T cells undergoing in vitro chronic stimulation displayed altered cell growth, increased expression of multiple checkpoint receptor molecules, decreased cytokine expression on re-stimulation, reduced target cell killing, and transcriptional heterogeneity reflective of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in human tumors. We leveraged this system to identify epigenetic and transcriptional regulators of many canonical phenotypes of T cell exhaustion, including increased checkpoint receptor expression and reduced effector cytokine expression. Ultimately, we unravel the network of factors that underlie T cells under chronic stimulation and identify novel factors that contribute to individual T cell phenotypes associated with exhaustion. Altogether, this work demonstrates how high-throughput genomic methods can be leveraged to understand novel facets of T cell differentiation and uncover regulators of T cell phenotype and fate.","vector":[-0.015204324387013912,-0.004713364411145449,-0.025115590542554855,0.027935510501265526,0.01428705733269453,0.08848761767148972,0.007940021343529224,0.08339916169643402,0.039139918982982635,0.05785344913601875,-0.015808068215847015,0.002741543808951974,0.06519408524036407,0.029422255232930183,0.01624324545264244,0.03749113157391548,0.03161807358264923,0.03298519551753998,-0.026110243052244186,-0.09770385921001434,0.05444703623652458,0.011938204057514668,0.053897444158792496,0.05809313431382179,-0.045513126999139786,-0.007378370501101017,-0.013964795507490635,0.056899454444646835,0.02536415122449398,-0.01797346957027912,-0.04949168115854263,0.016874859109520912,-0.05609762668609619,0.0005591421504504979,-0.05255519226193428,-0.00663713039830327,-0.08522676676511765,0.10189630836248398,-0.03678135946393013,-0.03799087926745415,-0.024599174037575722,-0.008799429051578045,-0.07872992753982544,0.00390186021104455,0.0374472439289093,-0.06771201640367508,0.08102460205554962,-0.0068419757299125195,-0.05548607558012009,0.0516725592315197,0.03336396440863609,0.09193169325590134,-0.02572162263095379,0.042440880089998245,0.009366350248456001,0.04622897878289223,-0.03476358577609062,0.04350696876645088,0.013137171044945717,-0.07659155130386353,-0.13570675253868103,-0.07351385802030563,0.08113468438386917,0.019787169992923737,0.031242599710822105,-0.02800225093960762,-0.044373590499162674,0.053061593323946,-0.0712527334690094,0.02633148804306984,-0.030048919841647148,0.003787216730415821,-0.07235970348119736,0.08521612733602524,0.017514169216156006,0.06241310015320778,0.059084806591272354,0.0009661662043072283,-0.006092021707445383,0.05685577169060707,0.06534416228532791,0.08303027600049973,0.08590607345104218,-0.013533350080251694,0.01048299577087164,-0.012232517823576927,0.03369654715061188,0.09068078547716141,0.032872699201107025,0.01220039650797844,0.04450533539056778,0.018038621172308922,0.00523988576605916,0.001650874619372189,-0.0013224806170910597,-0.04980570450425148,-0.003181926906108856,-0.03661850094795227,0.05614118650555611,-0.05738921836018562,-0.07177431136369705,-0.047259245067834854,-0.05868619680404663,0.10756010562181473,0.06577584147453308,0.003228947753086686,-0.019164210185408592,-0.0013513803714886308,-0.00018123134213965386,-0.02099754475057125,0.039719101041555405,-0.0332610048353672,0.028346378356218338,0.022442450746893883,0.054083552211523056,0.007393511012196541,-0.05919203907251358,-0.040253981947898865,0.1083090603351593,0.0008908701711334288,0.0624854750931263,-0.05498366057872772,-0.01649601384997368,0.04426412284374237,-0.019732799381017685,0.04801983758807182,0.011118690483272076,4.584922043176251e-33,0.016759999096393585,0.024213263764977455,-0.029916519299149513,0.09077094495296478,0.005948945879936218,-0.04339167848229408,0.06990426778793335,-0.0194805059581995,-0.009333206340670586,0.05548920854926109,-0.08041942119598389,0.0015018123667687178,0.054160404950380325,0.07603833824396133,-0.05512953922152519,0.03011280484497547,-0.10908040404319763,-0.01832531951367855,-0.02013568952679634,-0.048266246914863586,-0.0070597706362605095,0.05659327283501625,0.019826779142022133,-0.05940233916044235,-0.008657865226268768,0.0377529039978981,0.022377876564860344,0.09800341725349426,-0.058156050741672516,-0.03026493825018406,-0.027936110273003578,0.006606061477214098,-0.008995771408081055,-0.03290531039237976,0.026870276778936386,-0.021017175167798996,0.000495611340738833,0.014720294624567032,0.07354471832513809,-0.024145476520061493,-0.006096977740526199,-0.008730343542993069,-0.0342138409614563,-0.028783755376935005,-0.012168190442025661,-0.1571255475282669,-0.013899690471589565,-0.1079721748828888,-0.08927872031927109,0.051582369953393936,0.10574398189783096,0.011059953831136227,-0.007150411605834961,-0.034837014973163605,-0.10023931413888931,0.03333723172545433,-0.042163848876953125,0.031099991872906685,0.015155517496168613,0.023538071662187576,-0.04400927573442459,-0.06232614815235138,-0.03682052344083786,-0.017616163939237595,0.033911895006895065,0.03710436075925827,-0.08754666149616241,-0.02025587297976017,0.010251471772789955,-0.01287773810327053,0.14269664883613586,-0.07659335434436798,0.05247782915830612,-0.028984475880861282,0.02217901311814785,0.002587342169135809,0.04636700823903084,0.03704604506492615,-0.05901332199573517,0.03672834485769272,0.028742698952555656,-0.032756224274635315,-0.03909911960363388,0.0337715819478035,-0.03097178414463997,-0.11702815443277359,-0.01458799559623003,-0.10052928328514099,-0.04103339836001396,-0.060812413692474365,0.07217748463153839,0.0033827126026153564,0.029012704268097878,0.06845753639936447,-0.06175139173865318,-6.011845819431795e-33,0.04317827522754669,-0.0312979593873024,0.01919339969754219,-0.09309428185224533,0.006172304507344961,0.028246214613318443,-0.009271781891584396,0.01904129795730114,-0.04978499561548233,-0.054705288261175156,0.013267734088003635,-0.028177402913570404,-0.07342353463172913,0.0570194348692894,-0.060

{"title":"Re-imagining and expanding the diagnostic toolbox : towards robust and scalable molecular quantification","abstract":"Why is it that our local pharmacy only has pregnancy strips and CGMs as molecular monitors? What can we actually monitor at the doctors office reliably, and why not certain biomarkers? These are questions that underlay the body of work presented in this thesis. Particularly, I focus on some of the technical challenges of measuring and monitoring molecular biomarkers.   The field of precision medicine is entering a critical phase, with unprecedented access to vast computational resources and diverse data types such as CT scans, X-rays, and electronic health records. These resources, combined with powerful algorithms, have demonstrated significant potential for disease diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, molecular information has yet to be used in a scalable and reliable manner, although it is a critical component to understanding disease and health status. As a result, unraveling the basis and respective markers for disease and health remains a daunting task.   This thesis highlights and begins addressing some fundamental problems in scaling up the quantification of molecular biomarkers. Particularly, many current solutions assume that the intrinsic affinity between the affinity reagent and the target are the limiting factor, or view background signal and noise as an annoying feature. I will share some of our recent works that take advantage of these aspects to provide more robust and scalable molecular quantification techniques including: A method to tune molecular assays to expand the range of quantification across a larger portion of the proteomic dynamic range, a mathematical framework to relax the selectivity requirements on affinity reagents for assay design, assay development for scalable small molecule measurement, and a way to spatially minimize the effect of non-specific binding. These works take a step towards improving the way and scope of biomarkers that are measured from a fundamental level and have the potential to shift molecular quantification to be more accessible for medical diagnostics.","vector":[-0.03979489952325821,-0.04185269773006439,-0.06888586282730103,-0.04536031186580658,0.08149973303079605,-0.02967841736972332,0.010115785524249077,0.07503071427345276,0.012582109309732914,-0.03369807451963425,-0.06050284206867218,-0.06626645475625992,-0.0503988154232502,0.05553608387708664,-0.12115668505430222,0.046163272112607956,-0.035894230008125305,0.04674064740538597,0.012672742828726768,-0.02851596288383007,-0.089283287525177,0.04053262621164322,0.007719982881098986,0.08182916790246964,0.01384199783205986,0.025441890582442284,-0.040767282247543335,-0.06321225315332413,-0.04638722538948059,0.03265979513525963,0.06326896697282791,0.056040193885564804,0.023163650184869766,0.04074912145733833,-0.043692659586668015,0.027657855302095413,-0.05536358803510666,-0.002991963177919388,0.004846366588026285,-0.06643472611904144,0.08176176995038986,-0.0487360805273056,-0.08877331018447876,0.06762534379959106,0.050009336322546005,-0.06484062224626541,0.015599536709487438,0.0916302427649498,-0.0007391043473035097,0.10765279084444046,-0.02532385289669037,-0.04688592627644539,-0.05326317623257637,0.045095063745975494,-0.005850795190781355,-0.028963513672351837,-0.0690942332148552,-0.1228206530213356,-0.02223968878388405,-8.310264820465818e-05,-0.04483681544661522,-0.02616092935204506,-0.014110110700130463,-0.0036040362901985645,0.03421228751540184,0.03799515217542648,0.08367971330881119,-0.016433296725153923,0.023009296506643295,0.02745368517935276,-0.05134176090359688,0.09367931634187698,0.05148942023515701,0.13116031885147095,-0.023257296532392502,0.02935059182345867,0.024836037307977676,0.01334698311984539,0.03706788271665573,-0.07196928560733795,0.032911788672208786,0.006657506339251995,0.08645648509263992,0.07070840150117874,0.11136826127767563,-0.03016689047217369,0.03354261443018913,0.04392053559422493,-0.014205921441316605,-0.036655671894550323,0.014902014285326004,-0.020657135173678398,-0.003524418454617262,0.002217522356659174,0.004079282749444246,-0.021033769473433495,0.015507987700402737,-0.00606931559741497,0.037733711302280426,0.030512874945998192,-0.055804915726184845,0.004191902931779623,0.0009731190511956811,0.039255399256944656,-0.05034535005688667,-0.04098668321967125,0.005670866463333368,0.06235269084572792,0.012723113410174847,-0.009282039478421211,0.0017943716375157237,0.010691625997424126,0.035946134477853775,-0.02265733666718006,0.06179845705628395,0.005653809290379286,0.05968863517045975,-0.011456155218183994,0.05950051173567772,0.030421875417232513,-0.0581788532435894,-0.05396085977554321,-0.06748539209365845,-0.0053437333554029465,0.052149515599012375,0.096524678170681,-0.022058075293898582,4.114787118326708e-33,0.020497038960456848,0.06671887636184692,0.10608356446027756,0.01662289910018444,-0.016359305009245872,0.05409207195043564,-0.06751485168933868,-0.11409178376197815,-0.03107406757771969,0.05411535128951073,-0.04004901647567749,0.024903684854507446,0.01814435049891472,0.023333333432674408,0.03478417545557022,-0.00014736506273038685,0.01583225280046463,0.07243956625461578,-0.011399581097066402,-0.00787701178342104,-0.010525640100240707,-0.01985221542418003,-0.03487924858927727,-0.029879391193389893,-0.05044427514076233,0.07967273145914078,-0.05026904493570328,0.1008242815732956,0.0045253075659275055,0.003028355073183775,-0.08910162001848221,0.029015203937888145,0.07753486931324005,-0.02865137904882431,0.029441840946674347,-0.048774681985378265,0.031907353550195694,-0.050821807235479355,0.05816580355167389,0.07817105948925018,-0.007734955288469791,0.002324485220015049,0.03766601160168648,-0.041118644177913666,0.003130704164505005,-0.016779828816652298,-0.10148029029369354,0.03266824409365654,-0.05509399622678757,-0.0048019359819591045,0.016050947830080986,-0.061499759554862976,-0.03274688497185707,0.008436844684183598,-0.07138978689908981,0.018033277243375778,-0.10812053084373474,-0.08993121236562729,-0.0021502545569092035,0.0035218247212469578,0.00527018029242754,-0.008604155853390694,-0.0054174005053937435,-0.015561367385089397,-0.0416971817612648,-0.004703881684690714,-0.04209405556321144,-0.01392392534762621,-0.07989179342985153,0.12374070286750793,-0.04308650642633438,0.0771980956196785,0.08153338730335236,-0.059342093765735626,0.10437004268169403,0.05808119475841522,0.03174861520528793,0.07977922260761261,-0.014832476153969765,0.001966085284948349,0.012734193354845047,-0.003983232658356428,-0.01078429538756609,0.029370369389653206,-0.056860797107219696,-0.08138148486614227,0.02932576648890972,0.0369003601372242,-0.12788952887058258,-0.0357242114841938,-0.020393356680870056,0.026751721277832985,0.015578564256429672,-0.023223213851451874,-0.07242640852928162,-4.671496834772328e-33,-0.05069577321410179,-0.0121004031971097,0.01612871140241623,0.014910854399204254,-0.02609197236597538,0.012891821563243866,0.02584362030029297,-0.061668653041124344,0.04825852811336517,-0.03522243723273277,0.0753963440656662,-0.06743334978818893,-0.04554605111479759,-0.025362102314829

{"title":"Adversity roadmap : improving psychological well-being and resilience through a values-affirmation approach","abstract":"In this dissertation, I created a psychological roadmap for navigating adversity by grounding people in their core values. Research trends and global events have underscored the enduring significance of well-being and mental health. Central to this study is the self-affirmation theory, which proposes that humans possess an intrinsic need to perceive themselves as morally and adaptively capable, even when confronted with challenges. My objective was to tailor values-affirmation-based interventions to specific contexts and target groups, with the aim of enhancing well-being and motivation-related outcomes in the general population (Study 1), elite athletes (Study 2), and college students (Study 3). Study 1 involved a three-stage longitudinal randomized experiment conducted during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study evaluated the effectiveness of two versions of the values-affirmation intervention in mitigating pandemic-related psychological burdens, particularly the feelings of social disconnection and loneliness. Notably, the interventions proved most beneficial for men, who exhibited the sharpest decline in social belonging and mental health. In Study 2, I delved into the world of high-performance athletics. I identified two root causes of compromised psychological well-being among professional Dancesport athletes -- (1) high psychological stress, and (2) outcome-contingent self-worth. To address these challenges, I developed a novel \"Resilience Training + Affirmation\" (RTA) intervention. Results demonstrated promising advantages of RTA for athletes' mental health and self-efficacy. Furthermore, once the competitive stress had subsided, RTA bolstered athletes' sense of social belonging and reinforced their dance identities. The findings also indicated the RTA's potential to enhance resilience among Dancesport athletes, even in the face of unsatisfactory competition results, thereby mitigating the risks associated with outcome-dependent self-worth. Study 3 extended the insights from Study 1 to an educational context. By integrating established values-affirmation techniques with actionable plans, I aimed to assist students in establishing tangible links between their values and everyday experiences. I explore unexpected correlations between well-being outcomes and pertinent covariates, such as minority race, gender, social class, and first-generation status. My aspiration is that the discoveries outlined in this dissertation, along with future research endeavors, will pave the way for the development of finely tuned strategies capable of enhancing various

{"title":"The  ecology and evolution of social learning by predators","abstract":"Social learning may help foragers find food, but can cause competition. I first examined the evolution of social learning by predators in predator prey models, examining the ecological implications of three types of social learning: (1) unbiased social learning, in which social learners randomly choose a behavior from their demonstrators, (2) conformist social learning, in which learners are more likely to adopt the behavior used by most demonstrators, and (3) success-biased social learning, in which social learners copy successful demonstrators.  Unbiased and conformist social learning caused diet preferences and hence increased competition in the predator population, but success-biased social learning did not. I then examined the evolution of cooperative hunting when transmitted vertically (from parents to offspring) or horizontally between members of the same generation. When rare, cooperative hunting may allow predators to escape competition for prey caught alone, which we call the small prey, and may allow them to access \"big prey\" which cannot be caught alone, but a lonely cooperator cannot catch food unless it can transmit its behavior to another predator.  The cooperative hunting model found that vertical transmission of cooperative hunting is only sufficient for the evolution of cooperative hunting if predators stay near relatives. Otherwise, horizontal cultural transmission is essential for cooperative hunting. Ecological factors such as high availability of big prey and low availability of small prey further selected for cooperative hunting.","vector":[-0.0070730457082390785,-0.022502440959215164,-0.035746920853853226,0.007274006959050894,0.08120564371347427,0.009683194570243359,-0.019410235807299614,-0.05033951252698898,0.02193024381995201,0.060245491564273834,0.09593804180622101,0.013596415519714355,-0.0027945651672780514,0.08142730593681335,0.036081463098526,-0.02626667357981205,0.06901145726442337,0.01738625206053257,-0.007892644964158535,-0.02205481380224228,-0.06237008050084114,-0.08701913803815842,0.03895922005176544,0.006116863340139389,-0.11155825853347778,-0.06737478822469711,-0.012290189042687416,-0.027050718665122986,0.050847455859184265,-0.029322819784283638,0.0179681908339262,-0.03960394114255905,0.061173178255558014,-0.014299064874649048,-0.10658029466867447,-0.009024838916957378,0.020579226315021515,-0.051123153418302536,0.01478298008441925,0.027227846905589104,0.01808333955705166,-0.006281835492700338,-0.04501209408044815,-0.05240316689014435,-0.04397600144147873,-0.04341139271855354,-0.036946382373571396,-0.02817133255302906,-0.05355552211403847,-0.06285873055458069,-0.044366151094436646,-0.004228494595736265,-0.016331641003489494,0.030955752357840538,0.060476478189229965,-0.0005501544801518321,-0.0271830502897501,-0.014566035941243172,-0.01384665910154581,-0.07903483510017395,0.07547500729560852,-0.054471179842948914,-0.08360285311937332,-0.03140397369861603,-0.0018113476689904928,-0.06408356875181198,-0.0691874548792839,0.13152354955673218,-0.00433432636782527,-0.0026553019415587187,0.06429141014814377,0.017751378938555717,-0.023221781477332115,-0.018729934468865395,0.07715864479541779,0.0009723822004161775,0.021268265321850777,-0.07837249338626862,0.023167112842202187,-0.0558701828122139,0.004625413566827774,0.006178592797368765,-0.028424501419067383,-0.012540997005999088,0.03188958764076233,-0.09045351296663284,-0.03544776141643524,-0.023340940475463867,4.86510089103831e-06,-0.012949869967997074,-0.035201460123062134,0.06560111790895462,-0.05492744967341423,-0.03852786868810654,0.009576362557709217,0.030646782368421555,-0.027328724041581154,-0.028611309826374054,0.013559685088694096,0.03902089595794678,0.021892407909035683,0.015534710139036179,-0.020215719938278198,0.05956432968378067,0.060573235154151917,-0.057243186980485916,-0.07712233811616898,0.05075947567820549,0.07141201943159103,0.08398443460464478,-0.029574712738394737,0.08372802287340164,-0.026153424754738808,0.14964699745178223,0.008991212584078312,-0.02805105224251747,-0.048862069845199585,-0.02240886725485325,-0.0032143311109393835,0.07953140139579773,0.014297842048108578,0.015377156436443329,-0.002399163320660591,-0.03218022361397743,0.06375973671674728,-0.05586342513561249,-0.080363430082798,6.419322487278694e-33,-0.0010640851687639952,-0.05072944238781929,0.0024035016540437937,0.017709987238049507,0.0057963416911661625,-0.008917412720620632,-0.024296453222632408,0.02644144743680954,-0.034404344856739044,-0.0068375482223927975,-0.06062716990709305,-0.03328961133956909,0.025418009608983994,0.08544114232063293,0.06340402364730835,-0.006735336966812611,-0.07103163003921509,-0.003350711427628994,0.04932321980595589,0.010745962150394917,0.06723842024803162,-0.04296877235174179,0.039857398718595505,-0.06698593497276306,0.013301323167979717,-0.05014748126268387,-0.025829320773482323,-0.0625932514667511,-0.06303833425045013,0.061654139310121536,0.023253830149769783,-0.034721679985523224,-0.03997170552611351,0.032783541828393936,0.03950398415327072,0.001857945928350091,0.03400838002562523,-0.03341019153594971,-0.05021786317229271,-0.03696747496724129,0.0055190869607031345,-0.012299451977014542,0.058816105127334595,-0.016802722588181496,0.023252204060554504,-0.01665382832288742,0.05217760428786278,-0.010275729931890965,-0.11105982959270477,0.02475379779934883,0.0018047678750008345,-0.028195340186357498,0.028313955292105675,-0.11637309938669205,0.007892210967838764,0.09045001864433289,-0.0011739627225324512,0.01800963655114174,-0.10621495544910431,-0.08401530236005783,-0.023148881271481514,0.0002711081178858876,0.04950844123959541,0.03114846535027027,0.10275758057832718,0.05374448373913765,-0.009054167196154594,-0.09879322350025177,0.05817675590515137,-0.07028653472661972,0.06213975325226784,0.019696000963449478,-0.14524248242378235,-0.07952845841646194,0.05613899976015091,-0.02650666981935501,0.08524888753890991,0.029605526477098465,0.1072157770395279,-0.04090235009789467,-0.006889035925269127,-0.027797721326351166,-0.04493644833564758,-0.026459628716111183,-0.1431785672903061,0.006449275184422731,0.0679660364985466,-0.1325872838497162,0.0888325497508049,0.12341032177209854,-0.00774301216006279,-0.03869223967194557,-0.050753116607666016,0.0596202127635479,0.013542074710130692,-6.152833877185451e-33,-0.02553888037800789,-0.04677429050207138,0.007795060984790325,-0.0586235336959362,-0.04345551133155823,0.009474948979914188,-0.06710724532604218,-0.06206225976347923,-0.010578455403447151,-0.035070475190877914,-0.03866496682167053,0.08066525310277939,0.08036567270

{"title":"Multimode squeezing and quantum correlations of dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators","abstract":"Kerr soliton microcombs are phase-locked frequency combs generated in a microresonator via a third-order optical nonlinearity. Since their first demonstration, soliton microcombs have found applications in spectroscopy, LiDAR, communications, and convolutional processing. Experimental studies of soliton microcombs have also revealed a wealth of interesting nonlinear dynamics, and fundamental research on the classical dynamics continues to-date.   This thesis is divided into two parts: (I) the modeling and experimental observation of quantum processes in multimode nonlinear photonics; and (II) the engineering of silicon carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) integrated photonics for nonlinear and quantum technologies. Part I is general to all Kerr integrated photonics platforms.  However, in experimental realizations, the choice of photonics platform matters, not only because of a variation among materials in the raw strength of the nonlinearity but also because of additional properties that influence device engineering and ultimate performance. The development of the SiCOI nonlinear photonics platform enabled the experimental quantum optics demonstrations of this thesis, and will be the focus of Part II.","vector":[-0.07432486116886139,-0.03814410790801048,-0.052525363862514496,-0.0005376533954404294,-0.13186457753181458,-0.009979741647839546,0.02112366259098053,-0.02730993553996086,0.012785098515450954,-0.002074293326586485,0.043430767953395844,0.0246682558208704,-0.01971241645514965,0.012632827274501324,0.05057898163795471,0.09181784093379974,-0.013623218052089214,-0.002160965232178569,-0.023008383810520172,0.027259431779384613,0.0897461399435997,-0.09639667719602585,-0.01492240373045206,-0.06993980705738068,-0.020048143342137337,0.027678092941641808,0.06137396767735481,0.048759087920188904,-0.027232851833105087,0.03479079529643059,0.023322507739067078,0.05563843250274658,-0.007792050950229168,0.05515754595398903,-0.039058685302734375,-0.06476045399904251,0.043313805013895035,-0.0068791392259299755,-0.024906937032938004,-0.0212649367749691,-0.015235931612551212,-0.041872911155223846,0.008652471005916595,0.03788581117987633,0.04677867144346237,-0.011612404137849808,0.002190403174608946,0.0464356504380703,0.0015876070829108357,-0.09918659925460815,-0.03456699848175049,0.021786866709589958,0.0416007936000824,0.006533216219395399,-0.002905087312683463,0.05331679806113243,0.04420407488942146,0.03708735480904579,0.040076691657304764,-0.04244926944375038,0.05993181839585304,-0.011016398668289185,-0.08331149071455002,0.026719607412815094,-0.013579040765762329,-0.002752525731921196,0.017435533925890923,0.04370477795600891,-0.006312607787549496,0.051627349108457565,0.04824388399720192,-0.0776057168841362,-0.01916208304464817,0.008682464249432087,0.06612319499254227,0.007286963518708944,0.05842728167772293,0.1349136382341385,0.004851087927818298,0.006632453761994839,0.0017352055292576551,-0.05999433249235153,-0.04263817518949509,0.020575258880853653,0.001268021878786385,0.0012820771662518382,-0.03900609165430069,0.004318194463849068,-0.06416498869657516,-0.06291128695011139,-0.10146169364452362,0.0023845697287470102,-0.003971639554947615,-0.1400635540485382,0.18269608914852142,-0.040998756885528564,0.011860295198857784,-0.050366684794425964,0.054892197251319885,-0.013350768014788628,0.0344865657389164,-0.00829078909009695,-0.02776578813791275,0.033465493470430374,-0.06263965368270874,0.035740915685892105,0.061917904764413834,0.07637441158294678,-0.011856522411108017,0.01392221450805664,-0.02110486663877964,0.06516671925783157,0.04168766364455223,0.031223684549331665,-0.02932068333029747,0.028698626905679703,0.008037584833800793,0.11659740656614304,0.02297785133123398,0.06594925373792648,-0.07589910179376602,0.018949449062347412,-0.027605857700109482,-0.01660921610891819,-0.06636577844619751,0.05697881802916527,-0.005905600264668465,1.4463491418271185e-34,0.06342289596796036,0.019457707181572914,-0.004074308089911938,-0.029801011085510254,-0.025379827246069908,-0.06673894822597504,0.09243191033601761,-0.07600473612546921,-0.05805410072207451,0.015416549518704414,0.004339889623224735,-0.05229330062866211,-0.07823850959539413,0.04861435666680336,0.055147476494312286,-0.014762649312615395,-0.02189987525343895,-0.06509283185005188,0.005187475122511387,0.04680697247385979,-0.010975377634167671,-0.011164485476911068,0.03422176465392113,0.020586417987942696,-0.05034209415316582,-0.0042306724935770035,0.009695149026811123,-0.026796333491802216,-0.012032286264002323,0.0015198254259303212,0.001829837798140943,0.15227293968200684,-0.04742896556854248,-0.0005894422065466642,0.07215383648872375,0.03393079712986946,0.00794597901403904,0.04098743200302124,0.02626298926770687,0.01856585405766964,-0.033137209713459015,-0.06279748678207397,0.03620176017284393,0.010975976474583149,0.0021819286048412323,-0.07465875893831253,-0.046630289405584335,-0.053094856441020966,0.027066100388765335,0.004733975511044264,-0.01110324077308178,-0.04400760307908058,-0.037844933569431305,0.04489210993051529,0.10504473000764847,-0.05797446146607399,0.05971872806549072,-0.020861288532614708,-0.039202094078063965,-0.028860067948698997,-0.024256164208054543,-0.11630864441394806,0.07778733968734741,-0.0035766558721661568,-0.052932899445295334,0.050492722541093826,0.006091406103223562,0.02351640909910202,-0.04774421826004982,0.0065804473124444485,0.007021202705800533,0.08294528722763062,-0.02151649445295334,-0.04817379638552666,0.06296471506357193,0.011878382414579391,0.04261457175016403,-0.014778484590351582,-0.0012756285723298788,0.011609388515353203,0.09818842262029648,-0.040365222841501236,-0.04212028160691261,0.00036677622119896114,-0.046145249158144,0.01630774326622486,-0.06367980688810349,-0.05022462084889412,-0.10771538317203522,-0.06857748329639435,-0.010299334302544594,-0.0662003606557846,0.034456588327884674,-0.04037453979253769,-0.06457158923149109,-3.1340137740601174e-33,0.004936682526022196,-0.038137611001729965,0.011605662293732166,0.024846790358424187,0.04824356362223625,0.0574919618666172,0.005122726317495108,0.011979693546891212,0.006386503577232361,-0.022233594208955765,0.03730236366391182,0.009542352519929409,0.05925508216023445,0.0244

{"title":"Data-driven sustainability : advancing electric vehicle adoption and carbon accounting using artificial intelligence and geospatial analytics","abstract":"This dissertation explores data-driven, computational techniques for sustainability decision-making, particularly focusing on the transportation sector and the carbon accounting landscape. Given the urgency of large-scale decarbonization efforts underscored by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this work proposes and evaluates methods to help decision-makers navigate complex interactions between humans, engineering systems, and ecological systems, taking into account factors such as data accessibility and uncertainty. The dissertation is divided into two parts. The first, encompassing chapters two and three, delves into how computational techniques and data can expedite the decarbonization of the transportation sector. The second part, which includes chapters four and five, emphasizes elevating societal understanding and accounting of carbon emissions in the context of sustainable decision-making. Altogether, this dissertation underscores the importance of comprehensive, computationally-enhanced, data-driven, and uncertainty-aware approaches to sustainability decision-making, thus providing practical pathways for effective climate change mitigation.","vector":[0.016015825793147087,0.05849998816847801,0.030914345756173134,0.04996365308761597,-0.01168139185756445,-0.11664067208766937,-0.02206757478415966,0.029693666845560074,-0.02858062833547592,0.07271068543195724,-0.04383251070976257,-0.09720563143491745,0.04045889899134636,0.03438127040863037,-0.0694761723279953,0.033674340695142746,-0.040703967213630676,-0.015523452311754227,0.0062050060369074345,-0.0691136047244072,0.030648909509181976,0.012936276383697987,-0.07694147527217865,0.014970856718719006,0.0615854486823082,0.059046801179647446,-0.03721679747104645,0.02598399482667446,-0.017942747101187706,0.06957079470157623,-0.02164136990904808,0.035016387701034546,-0.008776698261499405,0.015540821477770805,-0.0233580581843853,0.03209174796938896,0.009050574153661728,-0.005416870582848787,0.019734324887394905,0.05307532474398613,-0.053186703473329544,-0.09281622618436813,-0.018349865451455116,-0.06322585046291351,-0.008900711312890053,-0.014388552866876125,0.009160728193819523,-0.03610380366444588,-0.022381750866770744,-0.07277573645114899,-0.01547585055232048,0.003099572379142046,-0.0027594801504164934,-0.03270988538861275,-0.07019363343715668,-0.06489427387714386,0.024338187649846077,-0.024450758472085,-0.046015430241823196,-0.04593946039676666,0.02852777950465679,-0.09699726849794388,-0.04228684678673744,0.03337358310818672,0.04227663576602936,0.053136810660362244,-0.05699736997485161,0.031852949410676956,0.002387503394857049,0.027988117188215256,0.014481419697403908,0.05888543650507927,-0.09878993034362793,-0.04771367460489273,-0.04436952993273735,-0.03285342827439308,0.026008740067481995,0.08419827371835709,0.08773113787174225,-0.04448603093624115,0.060697056353092194,0.05080530419945717,-0.009832743555307388,0.020546402782201767,0.037417277693748474,0.018015189096331596,0.023036202415823936,0.07408968359231949,0.07237344235181808,0.004380716942250729,-0.08126412332057953,-0.015802381560206413,0.13466373085975647,0.020432211458683014,-0.10067671537399292,0.09117571264505386,-0.00840744748711586,-0.0368247926235199,0.026494164019823074,0.037752628326416016,1.156663984147599e-05,0.03886136785149574,-0.033525388687849045,-0.05164217948913574,-0.04338259994983673,-0.044411830604076385,-0.0024318303912878036,-0.024011585861444473,0.0011164756724610925,-0.038496632128953934,-0.054258666932582855,0.001956445863470435,0.005563061218708754,0.035885218530893326,-0.018367556855082512,-0.013182218186557293,0.013036388903856277,-0.043383993208408356,0.03395621478557587,0.01881016418337822,-0.04187874123454094,0.02313285879790783,0.07117179781198502,-0.02204994298517704,0.024152137339115143,0.022861633449792862,0.014509176835417747,-1.5142140582021874e-33,-0.08399149030447006,-0.006368819158524275,0.0863250195980072,-0.003949581645429134,0.01782882586121559,-0.029462844133377075,-0.09972674399614334,-0.020021488890051842,-0.05576811730861664,0.03044198825955391,0.07077202945947647,0.057069554924964905,0.02719964273273945,0.05046543478965759,0.13906389474868774,-0.005102070048451424,-0.055995676666498184,0.009301275946199894,0.025207944214344025,-0.06994170695543289,0.013844016008079052,-0.07128124684095383,0.033794037997722626,0.026992617174983025,0.08866007626056671,-0.009731749072670937,0.008573160506784916,0.0423605814576149,0.041468095034360886,0.00132559216581285,0.035065144300460815,0.06073158234357834,-0.020544424653053284,-0.0517997071146965,0.043035272508859634,-0.03229701146483421,-0.049805786460638046,0.005642283242195845,-0.03307270631194115,0.043034449219703674,-0.052764687687158585,-0.0560402050614357,-0.036437273025512695,-0.026675749570131302,-0.033611249178647995,0.06771425902843475,0.11058463156223297,-0.0055427104234695435,-0.006666174624115229,0.03809799253940582,-0.02825295552611351,0.04425281658768654,0.02719000168144703,-0.07041873037815094,-0.07748398929834366,-0.035521578043699265,0.015163608826696873,-0.06017809361219406,-0.0593058280646801,-0.10299016535282135,-0.0728609710931778,-0.03121151030063629,0.05771748349070549,0.005375601816922426,0.07445966452360153,0.07909056544303894,-0.04281774163246155,0.07296104729175568,0.014479019679129124,-0.00037342932773754,0.008173967711627483,-0.043646953999996185,0.024878110736608505,0.021651552990078926,0.060181744396686554,-0.021370843052864075,0.005472548305988312,0.07518230378627777,-0.02255195379257202,-0.01371297799050808,-0.10289420932531357,0.0038142541889101267,-0.04316474124789238,-0.07991226762533188,0.04263782501220703,-0.04945971071720123,0.03561318293213844,0.04278480261564255,0.02523530088365078,-0.0238563884049654,-0.10835468769073486,0.03630315512418747,0.024716831743717194,0.003602951532229781,-0.004783318378031254,-1.9313715648765815e-33,-0.0027229366824030876,0.03490272909402847,0.03591694310307503,-0.02074146829545498,0.030640872195363045,-0.04414482042193413,-0.07632537931203842,-0.11449626833200455,0.10115944594144821,-0.02107960171997547,-0.09731043130159378,0.039060961455106735,0.09651105850934982,-0.0001084624

{"title":"Computational methods and mathematical measures for population relationships","abstract":"A population is the most central unit of study in population genetics. Patterns revealed by data on variation, both genetic and cultural, are important in understanding the composition and dynamics of populations. These patterns help unravel the driving forces behind evolutionary processes. Numerous statistics, mathematical models, and computational approaches have been developed to quantitatively analyze relationships within and between populations. To build upon these efforts, this dissertation investigates and devises computational methods and mathematical measures for studying various aspects of populations.  Chapters 2, 3, and 4 investigate the mathematical properties of genetic diversity measures used to quantify the variation within and between populations. Chapters 5 and 6 study the challenge of cluster alignment in analyzing and visualizing population structure analysis results. Chapters 7 and 8 adapt population-genetic approaches to study the patterns of composition and change in cultural traits. Collectively, the studies conducted in the dissertation introduce tools to improve existing approaches, to devise new frameworks, and to resolve previously unaddressed issues in analyzing population relationships. The advancements also demonstrate potential applications in fields beyond population genetics.","vector":[0.018189219757914543,0.046819522976875305,-0.020431075245141983,0.00477498397231102,-0.03444913029670715,0.031104883179068565,-0.053796734660863876,-0.08503073453903198,0.02624429576098919,-0.041856568306684494,0.0787416473031044,-0.1522572934627533,0.056732673197984695,0.009873722679913044,-0.07035020738840103,0.00627734512090683,-0.0860215574502945,0.024404872208833694,-0.054622482508420944,-0.05336465314030647,-0.03800346702337265,0.017668509855866432,0.04439985379576683,0.06135362386703491,-0.05510340631008148,-0.0001331463863607496,0.11660865694284439,0.05949706584215164,0.00677906209602952,-0.0030993912369012833,0.05092719569802284,0.08644399791955948,0.056607723236083984,0.0025856904685497284,-0.06972013413906097,0.0801009088754654,-0.06673919409513474,0.103851817548275,0.035647690296173096,0.0798584371805191,-0.02992224134504795,0.06307262182235718,0.0676172748208046,0.024355152621865273,0.0400223471224308,0.056158360093832016,-0.1026218831539154,0.002070444170385599,-0.06083487346768379,0.07510192692279816,-0.09799101203680038,0.057696666568517685,-0.011840710416436195,0.0079259742051363,0.034030038863420486,0.012207316234707832,0.06033051386475563,-0.0636109784245491,-0.011613734997808933,0.008275293745100498,0.07173967361450195,0.009325087070465088,-0.027925003319978714,-0.021756112575531006,0.033529262989759445,0.07075770199298859,0.01276952214539051,0.04460451379418373,0.028740664944052696,-0.06259933859109879,-0.02428911253809929,0.09756766259670258,-0.08477974683046341,0.1495356559753418,-0.024453364312648773,0.05060555413365364,-0.02075284533202648,0.0061326404102146626,-0.0591241754591465,-0.044013187289237976,0.030160561203956604,-0.005640323739498854,0.02478192374110222,-0.008112533949315548,0.07278165966272354,-0.02819085866212845,-0.029379162937402725,-0.051623985171318054,-0.02615315653383732,0.030820121988654137,-0.1023576408624649,0.07458417117595673,0.07842468470335007,-0.03600505739450455,-0.010878399945795536,0.0803568959236145,0.03797776252031326,-0.04186650738120079,0.12185141444206238,0.05833277106285095,0.02383127622306347,-0.020561469718813896,0.06914921849966049,-0.032907646149396896,-0.049349065870046616,-0.14495182037353516,-0.031665556132793427,-0.009820959530770779,-0.03294263407588005,-0.03394721820950508,0.039662156254053116,-0.04246066138148308,-0.09117043763399124,0.13853545486927032,-0.0397942028939724,-0.0468631237745285,0.07076562196016312,-0.005361342802643776,0.021288812160491943,0.07548096776008606,0.03783716261386871,0.02050534449517727,-0.06799930334091187,0.031131064519286156,0.01485395710915327,0.019738120958209038,-0.10379264503717422,2.0156982235267107e-33,-0.054746948182582855,-0.06378738582134247,0.05838054418563843,0.09791294485330582,0.005304190795868635,-0.05317587032914162,-0.02092278003692627,-0.057309363037347794,-0.06809930503368378,0.006899271626025438,-0.017073549330234528,-0.00816724169999361,-0.0159209705889225,0.02675834484398365,-0.026641083881258965,0.013277718797326088,-0.011685492470860481,0.06057627499103546,-0.05946379899978638,0.04015330970287323,-0.010441203601658344,0.05049486085772514,0.03824043273925781,0.011502884328365326,-0.04766532778739929,-0.03103720210492611,-0.024829549714922905,-0.05502031743526459,-0.07174725085496902,-0.022969629615545273,0.01600024476647377,-0.028017815202474594,-0.06432534754276276,-0.016284294426441193,0.05861653387546539,0.008922639302909374,0.08955798298120499,-0.08355478197336197,0.00520011130720377,0.012410322204232216,-0.033661771565675735,-0.02098190225660801,0.03175731375813484,-0.03632260113954544,0.002853021025657654,0.023837732151150703,0.05768168345093727,-0.02268684282898903,-0.005950665567070246,0.009823131375014782,-0.08906560391187668,-0.0072748102247715,0.10813546180725098,0.032084446400403976,-0.02558707818388939,0.02877003327012062,-0.017482459545135498,0.0519525520503521,-0.05265674740076065,0.020943952724337578,-0.023847604170441628,-0.00501684146001935,0.007112413644790649,0.007850666530430317,0.10951260477304459,-0.04266819357872009,-0.011231910437345505,0.0697777196764946,0.03548714891076088,0.05088958516716957,0.0883888527750969,-0.032543569803237915,-0.06441505998373032,-0.010554617270827293,-0.06904583424329758,0.05738549679517746,0.05655638128519058,0.03246142715215683,-0.009224403649568558,-0.0813976377248764,-0.05415532365441322,0.07560259848833084,-0.08776906877756119,-0.07285985350608826,-0.07655809074640274,0.005986639764159918,0.10061602294445038,0.022968295961618423,-0.018073968589305878,-0.036910634487867355,0.04031362757086754,0.01291602198034525,0.044138144701719284,-0.009331321343779564,0.056458666920661926,-4.119248854072048e-33,-0.1287868618965149,0.01710199937224388,0.039906419813632965,-0.0709565058350563,-0.02539777383208275,-0.030487002804875374,0.00656961090862751,0.026377880945801735,-0.017255766317248344,-0.051543064415454865,-0.014769859611988068,-0.01643277332186699,0.08757498860359192,-0.006573149934411049,-0.047896210104227066,0.

{"title":"Many-body spin physics with quantum gases in a confocal cavity","abstract":"Ultracold gases confined inside optical cavities enjoy photon-mediated interactions enhanced by the cavity's cooperativity and have brought on new paradigms in many-body physics. Carefully engineered light-mediated interactions between multilevel atoms can render this a study of spin physics. In this dissertation I describe the realization of various exotic many-body spin phases in a cavity apparatus that can be tuned between a traditional single-mode configuration and multimode confocal geometry. I will demonstrate the realization of a spin-textured checkerboard, along with a checkerboard with dislocation. Then, the cavity is used to realize dynamical spin-orbit coupling. Finally, I demonstrate the realization of a novel, fully-connected, vector spin glass unique to the confocal
